# Change streams

This article explores the change streams that impact the roadmap and scope of planned activities. Planning for how to deal with these changes throughout the program is a key determiner of success.

In other articles, we've discussed the approach to digital transformation and how to develop a transformation plan for your application and the process involved. It's traditionally been a top-down approach, starting at the business model and then narrowing down to business processes and applications that deliver the most impact. However, you should always keep in line with the broader theme of constant change and embrace the mindset of getting comfortable with frequent and inevitable change.  

## Business

When you start the journey of transformation, you start building the business application based on the goals set by the business. At this point, it's also important to appreciate that during design and implementation, you may need to accommodate for further adjustments and refinements. This support for agility and change needs to be fundamentally built into the program. This is where some of the iterative methodologies could be beneficial, enabling us to respond to the change without it turning into a disruption.

> Embrace the mindset of getting comfortable with frequent and inevitable change.

The people that lead the transformational change often find that all aspects of change aren't well defined in the early stages. So it's key to iterate to adopt changes quickly and early, but so is flexibility as clarity reveals the resulting business model. When transformation occurs in an industry, what the industry looks like following the transformation is often not known. Companies must be able to adapt quickly in the middle of the project to incorporate these inevitable changes.

## User

A key stakeholder in your transformation plan is the business user, who interacts with the application often. If you're implementing a process in the application that doesn't meet the needs of the users, it can lead to poor adoption and lack of engagement. The same applies if the application doesn't consider working patterns and end user usage. Incorporating user feedback continuously throughout the process using well-defined and frequent touchpoints is key to achieving your transformation goals.

Your approach to designing and developing the application needs to be user-centric; it must clearly articulate how the change being implemented results in value for the user.

You should expect that user experience expectations constantly evolve as users are exposed to various software products both in the enterprise and consumer space. For example, the predictive text fill feature popularized by web search engines is now the expected search experience in business applications. It's now even more important to adopt newer features and improvements delivered by cloud solutions.

## Product and technology

In the world of cloud-based applications, you can expect a constant flow of new capabilities, improvements to existing features, and transitions to the latest technology paradigms, which can impact your current application. Traditionally, the IT team provided the business applications, with features requested by the business and end users. With the cloud, the service providers themselves are invested in understanding the latest trends in business and delivering innovative capabilities to help their customers stay ahead of the competition.  

For example, a business tries to transform their sales application and assembles an application using the best-in-class sales capabilities offered by the service provider. the alternative was to spend years in research, design, and development to build from scratch, which would make the application obsolete by the time it launches.

Similarly, continued investment in microservices by Dynamics 365, such as planning as a service, can transform a core business model for companies. They can run material requirements planning (MRP) as needed to drive a significant and transformative way of managing demand and the supply chain.

The enhancement delivered via continuous updates has a shorter adoption timeframe when compared to traditional major version upgrades.

SaaS application providers that are competing to build and deliver business capabilities for customers are helping advance business applications in way that was unimaginable just a few years ago. Applications that were just forms over data have evolved into applications that can automatically capture data, learn from the data, deliver insights, and guide users to the next best action. Before, they were mostly passive data capture systems used to track, view, and report on known data. It's more important now for business to watch for new capabilities being made available and adopt them to accelerate their transformation to be a differentiator in the industry. The key value proposition of SaaS is also the ability to tap into the enhancements and features that are based on broad market research. Activating these features can accelerate your transformation with minimal effort and without any development cost.

Your SaaS application provider is no longer just a software vendor providing an off-the-shelf product, they're a strategic partner to your business with significant impact on your ability to implement your strategy. Developing a strong relationship with the SaaS providers to not just learn about the roadmap but also influence the roadmap through strategic feedback ensures that you're getting the most value out of the product.

## External

External economic, social, and political drivers can disrupt your transformation plan. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of how supporting remote work and creating online collaboration channels became a top priority for most customers in 2020. This required coordinated changes from infrastructure, to network, to the device and application layer across the IT landscape of organizations. Although it's difficult to foresee and plan for external events, the iterative approach to delivering continuous value in smaller batches allows you to pause and pivot as needed.  

For example, an organization is on a long-term transformation program that releases a major capability to users once a year. In contrast, an organization has adopted the DevOps culture of delivering value with regular bi-monthly or monthly updates. The latter company can realize value from investments sooner and is better positioned to pivot when change demands it.
