# What are the options for regression testing?

As Microsoft releases Dynamics 365 service updates, you must reduce the risk of introducing regressions into production. Regressions can negatively impact internal users, but they may also impact the service you provide to your customers. While Microsoft does its own regression testing, the data composition, specific customer configurations, and unique extensions mean customers must perform their own regression testing in their own environment. By automating this testing, you can reduce the overall effort from days or weeks to hours.  

## Suggested solutions

The following illustration provides an overview of suggested solutions that you can use for regression testing. But there are other solutions out there, so choose one that works for your project.

## Subscriptions versus free of charge

Review each of the solution capabilities to ensure the return on investment, *ROI*, fits your business need. We recommend you review solution installation, test case creation, product support, and ongoing maintenance of the test cases. The total cost of ownership, *TCO*, may be lower for a paid solution, depending on your environment's complexity and size. 

## No recommendations from Microsoft

Each organization has a unique environment and profile. That's why we can't recommend one solution over another. We recommend that you evaluate the capabilities of each of the solutions against your business needs. Use the provided links for more information.
