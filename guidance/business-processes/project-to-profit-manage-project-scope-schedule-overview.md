# Manage project resources and schedule overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to define your resources for a porject, and to schedule your costs and revenue.

Resources and schedule are critical during the project lifecycle. The ability to track these two types of information help you make sure that your project is in a healthy state. Start at the beginning of your project by defining a baseline. Then, during the project's lifecycle, you refine it through estimation to complete by adjusting resources and schedule.

As a project manager, your first steps are to collect requirements, define the project scope, and plan the project, including all costs required and revenue generated. With all these elements, you can create and define a first budget baseline that you follow. Then during the project lifecycle, you reassess periodically the resources and schedule to reflect changes, and you validate that your project is profitable according to the baseline.

This business process should be defined and incorporated into the overall implementation during the project planning phase. It's typically the first step of your project.

## Stakeholders 

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Manage project resources and schedule* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- Project manager

- Audit department

- Finance department

- Executive sponsor

## Manage project resources and schedule process flow 

The following diagram illustrates the *Manage project resources and schedule* business process area.

Each solid gray rectangle on the diagram represents an end-to-end business process. The solid blue rectangle represents business process area. The diagram shows the subprocesses for this business process area. The arrows on the diagram show the flow of the business process in an organization. If a subprocess can lead to more than one other subprocess, the parallel subprocesses are shown as branches.

The flow diagram covers the following steps.

1. Start

2. *Project to profit* end-to-end process
 
3. *Govern projects* business process area  

4. *Manage project resources and schedule* business process area

    1. *Collect project requirements*

    2. *Define project scope*, including deliverables

    3. *Plan project*

    4. *Validate resources and schedule*

    5. *Create project*

    6. *Create work breakdown structure* with all required costs (resources, materials, fees, and so on) and dependencies

    7. *Update estimates to complete*, - first, you define the baseline, and on a periodic basis you then refine the estimates to complete

    8. *Monitor scope delivered* and review the progress of your deliverables

    9. *Control resources and schedule* and review if you stick to the plan or you have deviations

    10. *Revise resources and schedule* and update resources and schedule according to project's events

5. End
