# Manage project supply chain overview

***This applies to: Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Microsoft Supply Chain Center***

The *Manage project supply chain* overview aims to provide insights into the significance of project supply chain management, particularly considering current trends and challenges within the supply chain landscape.

Effective project supply chain management ensures the seamless flow of goods, services, and information from the initial project conception to its completion. It involves planning, implementing, and controlling activities to optimize efficiency, minimize costs, and meet customer demands.

The current supply chain trends and challenges further highlight the importance of project supply chain management. Rapid technological advancements, globalization, and changing consumer preferences have led to increased complexity and volatility within supply chains. Factors like shorter product life cycles, sustainability concerns, and supply chain disruptions require organizations to adapt and innovate continuously.

Organizations can gain a competitive advantage if they adopt robust project supply chain management practices. They gain enhanced visibility, mitigation of risks, improved customer satisfaction, and optimized resource allocation. Effective management of suppliers, logistics, inventory, and communication throughout the project lifecycle becomes important for success.

In conclusion, project supply chain management is a vital discipline that enables organizations to navigate the evolving supply chain landscape. By embracing best practices, organizations can overcome challenges, capitalize on emerging trends, and drive operational excellence in their projects.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization contribute to the decision-making within the *manage project supply chain* process. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Project managers**: Project managers are responsible for overseeing the entire project and ensuring that the supply chain is effectively managed. They coordinate with various stakeholders, set project goals, allocate resources, and monitor progress.

- **Suppliers**: Suppliers play a crucial role in the supply chain management process. They provide the necessary materials, goods, or services required for the project. Suppliers need to be dependable, efficient, and able to meet project requirements within specified timelines.

- **Project team members**: The project team members involved in the supply chain management process are essential stakeholders. They can include individuals from various departments, such as procurement, operations, inventory management, and quality control. Effective collaboration and communication among team members are vital for successful supply chain management.

- **Supply chain managers**: These professionals oversee and coordinate all activities within the supply chain. They aim for an efficient flow of goods and services, and they manage inventory levels and optimize logistics processes to meet customer demands.

- **Procurement team**: The procurement team is responsible for sourcing and acquiring goods and services needed for the project. They negotiate with suppliers, manage contracts, and ensure timely procurement of materials while maintaining quality standards and cost-effectiveness.

- **Finance department**: The finance department plays a crucial role in the supply chain management process. They manage budgets, analyze financial data, monitor costs, and ensure financial viability and profitability. They also manage invoicing, payments, and financial reporting related to the supply chain activities.

Overall, these roles within the project supply chain management process work together to ensure smooth operations, optimize costs, maintain product quality, meet customer demands, and achieve project objectives.

> The number of stakeholders may vary depending on the nature of the project, industry, and organizational structure. This list provides a general overview of the key participants in project supply chain management.

## Manage project supply chain process flow

The following diagram illustrates the *Manage project supply chain* business process area. The business process flow involves several interconnected tasks and activities that aim to efficiently manage the flow of materials, information, and resources from the initial project planning stage to the final delivery of goods or services.

Each solid gray rectangle on the diagram represents an end-to-end business process. The solid blue rectangle represents business process area. The diagram shows the subprocesses for this business process area. The arrows on the diagram show the flow of the business process in an organization. If a subprocess can lead to more than one other subprocess, the parallel subprocesses are shown as branches.

        2. Human resources available? (Step 11)

5. Purchased or produce materials?

    1. A parallel branch for the produce decision leads to *Produce materials (step 6)*

    2. A parallel branch for the purchase decision leads to *Purchase materials (step 8)*

6. *Produce materials*

7. *Plan to produce* end-to-end process

8. *Purchase materials*

9. *Procure to pay* end-to-end process

10. *Consume materials*

11. Human resources available?

    1. A parallel branch for No leads to *Borrow resources from other legal entity (step 12)*

    2. A parallel branch for Yes leads to *Work on project (step 13)*

    3. A parallel branch for No leads to *Onboard subcontractor (step 16)*

12. *Borrow resources from another legal entity*

13. *Resources work on project*

14. *Manage resources work*

    1. A parallel branch to Approve time

        1. Deliver project work

    2. A parallel branch to Approve expenses

        1. Capture project expenses

15. *Project to Profit end-to-end process*
