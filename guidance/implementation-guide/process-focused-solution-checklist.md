# Checklist for process-focused solutions

## Business processes focus

- Make sure the business process view of the organization is at the core of the definition of the project.

- Clearly articulate the key business processes that are in scope and the respective personas so all parties involved in the implementation understand them.

- Make sure business model analysis, process engineering, and standardization strategies are part of the project definition. This way, you deliver a strong process baseline before implementation starts.

- Collect the business processes in a structured and hierarchical process catalog during the requirements phase.

## Process-centric solution

- Use business processes for each phase of the project to deliver better outcomes (all phase activities are better planned, performed, and measured).

## Opportunity for optimization

- Explore opportunities to evolve, optimize, and consolidate your processes as part of the implementation to meet the digital transformation goals and drive user adoption.

- Make sure the business process definition is complete and considers all activities and subprocesses.

- Take advantage of the latest SaaS technology to drive efficiency and effectiveness for the process optimization.

- Make sure future readiness when mapping your business process to the solution by incorporating configurability by design.

## Fit gap analysis

- Adopt a fit-to-standard approach and align to the philosophy of adopting wherever possible and adapting only where justified.
