# Checklist: Project Governance

## Project goals

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Ensure goals are clear, realistic, mapped to actions and measures, correctly translated into project deliverables, and regularly monitored throughout the project lifecycle.|
|&check;|Align goals and ensure they're sponsored by relevant stakeholders across the organization, and properly communicated and understood by the implementation team.|

## Project organization structure

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Align business streams with functional workstreams for better efficiency and structure, and make sure the business stream is directly involved in the project.|
|&check;|Secure strong executive sponsorship and active engagement from senior business stakeholders within each business stream.|
|&check;|Ensure cross-team collaboration in which members of each workstream are involved in other workstreams to avoid working in silos.|
|&check;|Plan and budget the project resources in proportion to the effort and complexity of the project.|
|&check;|Define accountability and responsibility at the project leadership level. Each stream identifies an owner with autonomy who is empowered to make decisions.|
|&check;|Identify relevant project roles and areas of ownership and assign them to team members with the right expertise and experience.|

## Project approach

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Analyze, review, and confirm that your chosen implementation methodology works well with the business and project constraints and circumstances.|

## Classic governance

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Establish an effective steering group that understands enough of the project details to actively steer the project based on meaningful, actionable, and evidence-based information.|
|&check;|Create a risk register with meaningful and actionable risks that align with project priorities and are actively addressed.|
|&check;|Implement stage gate or milestone-driven planning and reviews as checkpoints to better track and communicate implications of the project status.|
|&check;|Implement design review boards to ensure new designs and changes operate within the boundaries of the solution blueprint and don't adversely affect other designs.|
