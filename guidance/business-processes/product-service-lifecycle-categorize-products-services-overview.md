This article describes how to categorize, segment, and merchandise products and services in Dynamics 365 solutions.

All organizations group and categorize or segment their products and services into logical groupings for various reasons. At the beginning of your Dynamics 365 implementation project, you should consider how you will implement these groupings.

Categorization, merchandising, and segmentation of products and services are related concepts. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings and functions in the system.

- *Categorization* is the process of grouping products or services based on shared characteristics.
- *Segmentation* is the process of dividing a market (of customers, typically) into smaller groups (or segments) based on shared characteristics or interests.
- *Merchandising* is the process of presenting products or services in an appealing and attractive way to customers.

<!-- It's important for an organization to consider carefully how it categorizes, segments, and merchandises the products and services it offers.-->Often, organizations that adopt Dynamics 365 are already working with such groupings. It's important to consider whether your current mechanism for categorizing products and services still meets all your business requirements. The implementation of a new technology solution is often a good time to consider making changes to the structure as the business requires. For example, consider the following questions:

- How do you drive downstream business processes and automation?
- How do you report and analyze your data, including operational reporting and financial reporting?
- How has your business grown since the organization first started to use categorization, segmentation, or merchandising?
- How do you anticipate that your business will grow in the future?

The answers to these questions should help inform your process for defining how you implement a technology solution to support the categorization of products and services. The *categorize product and services* business process area should always be considered early in a Dynamics 365 implementation project. Additionally, consider the number of changes that might be made to the data in this area. Such changes can make integrations, data migration, and other aspects of your project more complex.

When an organization starts a Dynamics 365 implementation, it's important to carefully consider how you define the product lines in the system. Tasks include setting up item groups and [product categories](/dynamics365/supply-chain/pim/tasks/classify-product-category-hierarchies) in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, [product families](/dynamics365/sales/create-product-family) in Dynamics 365 Sales, and [item groups](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-categorize-items) or [item attributes](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-work-item-attributes) in Dynamics 365 Business Central. The *categorize product and services* business process area also includes the definition of product policies. We recommend that you group similar items together, based on the expected behaviors that they need in the system. Examples include [item model groups](/dynamics365/supply-chain/pim/product-configuration-models), reservations, storage, and tracking dimensions in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

Additionally, if your organization offers multiple types of products and services, you must define the rules and configurations for each type of product that you offer. For example, you can use catch weight items in the chemical industry or the food and beverage industry. Consigned inventory, which is common in some industries,  requires other setup, configuration, and considerations. Service industries have other considerations for services that are offered, including warranties and installation. Many organizations charge additional fees or service charges for tangible items that are sold, and this approach might require other considerations. Dynamics 356 supports various flexible configurations to support many types of products and services, and to support additional fees and charges that might be charged to customers or imposed by suppliers.

After you create the basic definition of how you organize products, you can start to categorize and build hierarchical structures of products. The following list outlines some options:

- Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Commerce support multiple flexible [hierarchies](glossary.md#product-hierarchy) for procurement, sales, channel management, and more.
- In Dynamics 365 Sales, you can create hierarchies of products by using [product families](glossary.md#product-family).
- In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, you can create and manage [subjects](glossary.md#subject) to manage complex hierarchies. For example, hierarchies can represent products, brands, or types of issues that your customers report.
- In Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, [segments](/dynamics365/customer-insights/journeys/segmentation-lists-subscriptions) help you group customers based on their buying habits. One common segment is typically related to the products that customers purchase. Organizations can define many segments, based on many different attributes of the products that are purchased.
- In Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can combine [categories, attributes, and variants](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-categorize-items#categories-attributes-and-variants) to fit your needs.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of theÂ *categorize product and services* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Marketing stakeholders**: Includes roles such as the Marketing Manager, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Analyst, Advertising, and Coordinator. The Marketing department is responsible for developing and implementing marketing strategies based on the categorization and segmentation of products and services. Involve marketing stakeholders in the implementation of the technology solution to ensure that it supports their marketing initiatives.
- **Sales stakeholders**: Includes roles such as the Sales Rep, Account Executive, Business Development Manager, Sales Manager, Sales Director, Sales Engineer, Inside Sales, Key Account Manager, Channel Sales Manager, and Chief Sales Officer (CSO). The sales stakeholders are responsible for selling the products and services. Involve them in the implementation of the technology solution to ensure that it supports their sales efforts.
- **Customer service stakeholders**: Includes roles such as Rep, Manager, Supervisor, and Director. Customer service stakeholders are responsible for providing support to customers. Involve them in the implementation of the technology solution to ensure that it meets the needs of customers.
- **Finance stakeholders**: Includes roles such as Controller, Director, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The finance stakeholders are responsible for budgeting and financial reporting. Involve them in the implementation of the technology solution to ensure that it's aligned with the organization's financial objectives.
- **Executive management stakeholders**: Involve executive management in the implementation project to ensure that it aligns with the organization's overall strategy and objectives, and to provide support and resources for the implementation.

## Categorize products and services benefits

There are many key benefits that can be used to monitor and measure the success of implementing technology to support the *categorize products and services* area. The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might monitor and measure for *categorize products and services*.

### Streamlined product and service categorization

Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Dynamics 365 Business Central provide tools for categorizing products and services based on shared characteristics, such as attributes, categories, and subcategories. Categorization makes it easier to manage and organize products and services, and to create targeted marketing strategies. When you use other Dynamics 365 applications together with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you can use [dual-write maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-home-page) to automatically synchronize the product details to other tables and entities, to support the business needs in many other applications.

### Improved customer insights

When you use Dynamics 365 to categorize your products and services, your organization can gain insights into the needs and preferences of its customers. The organization can then use this information to tailor its offerings to meet the specific needs of different customer groups. For example, in Dynamics 365 Marketing, you can create a dynamic segment. The segment is then automatically updated when customers purchase a specific type of item and promotes a similar item by using a customer journey. By using this approach, you can create more targeted marketing strategies that can ultimately make your marketing campaigns more effective and improve the return on investment of your campaign.

### Optimized product development

When an organization understands the needs and preferences of different customer groups, it can develop products and services that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace. This approach can help minimize the risk of product failures and reduce development costs. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Dynamics 365 Commerce include flexible product categorization and attributes to support unique industry and localization requirements. When you combine this capability with Power BI, you can easily analyze the data to determine which customers and products are performing better. You can use similar functionality that is available in Dynamics 365 Sales to create product families and analyze the sales data by using Power BI.

### Increased customer loyalty

When an organization can tailor its offerings to meet the needs of different customer groups, it can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. One result can be higher retention rates and increased customer lifetime value. Dynamics 365 Commerce includes a loyalty program that enables you to track sales across every channel, and Dynamics 365 Customer Insights enables you to pull sales data from many different sources for analysis. <!--When you use the categorization or segmentation features available in Dynamics 365 to TODO: THIS SENTENCE WAS UNFINISHED AT SUBMISSION-->

### Optimized customer experiences

When you use subjects in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to manage cases, you can model them after categories of products and services. This approach might help you categorize and analyze cases based on the subjects of cases that are created and worked on. When automated routing is used together with cases, it can improve the customer experience by ensuring that the right person is assigned to the ticket to help fix the issue. This approach can be especially relevant in organizations or industries where the product or service mix is diverse. Even in organizations or industries where the product or service mix isn't diverse, subjects can still help analyze trends for a given product line, product type, or service, for example. This analysis can then help you determine whether more training is required or quality issues exist.
