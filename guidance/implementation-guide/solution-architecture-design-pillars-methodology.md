# Solution architecture design: Methodologies

A methodology is a collection of methods used to achieve predictable outcomes. Good methodology also demonstrates why things need to be done in a particular order and fashion. The Success by Design framework is a higher-level abstraction through which a range of concepts, models, techniques, and methodologies can be clarified. It can bend around any methodology, so choose the methodology that works best for you.  

To achieve your solution, the workflows and delivery need to be planned, organized, communicated by various methods, including:

- Project management  
- Change management

- Governance and control

## Project management

There are multiple project management methodologies and approaches. The methodology that you choose for enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a topic that can generate more heat than light. Partners often rely on their own branded methodology to reassure customers about their governance. Project management approaches can be grouped into three core categories:

- Waterfall

- Agile

- Hybrid

As we move increasingly toward a low-code world, there are faster deployments and fewer customizations, and your approach should match the changing world and your customers' expectations.

## Change management

Project management (the *how*) and change management (the *who*) are both tools that support your project's benefits realization. Without a change management plan in place, your organization's objectives are at risk. To drive adoption with your end users and accelerate value realization, apply a vigorous change management approach, which is most effective when launched at the beginning of a project and integrated into your project activities.

The benefits of a solid change management approach are:

- It focuses on the people side of organizational change.

- It seeks individual and organizational perspectives.

- It requires action and involvement by leaders and managers throughout the organization.

## Governance

The term *governance* often brings to mind just project management or possibly even stakeholder management, but such a limited view of governance may cause an organization to ignore core elements required for success.

Every project component contains an element of uncertainty and is based upon assumptions made before details are known or fully understood. So, if we know this, why would we expect a project manager to be solely responsible for project governance? The project manager is accountable for the project outcome, but 360-degree governance requires everyone, especially the architects and leads, to play a role.

A 360-degree governance method directly affects how well the project team performs and the ultimate result, and is executed on multiple levels:

- A governance board or steering committee has final responsibility for meeting the project goals. It typically consists of representatives or stakeholders from each of the major participants.

- A project manager leads the team and administers project elements that include alignment, risk identification and mitigation, escalation, and cross-Microsoft collaboration.

- All project leaders, including the project manager, solution architect, and technical architect, closely communicate and align toward the common goal of solution deployment.

- The technical architect leads and orchestrates the technical architecture across all application components to ensure optimal performance.

- The solution architect guides users toward the new vision and transformation.

- The change manager ensures all internal and external communications are in place.
