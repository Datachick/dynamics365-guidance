# Case study in driving app value

Dynamics 365 helps adapt business processes to change. Let's go through an example of how change management is key to the success of an implementation strategy.

## Story

We're back in 2020. One of our clients, an accounting network, faces unique and unexpected challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has inhibited face-to-face work, threatened global supply chains, and shifted regulatory and political landscapes.

## Case Study

To maintain business continuity and stay connected with customers, the company adapts their digital selling techniques with Dynamics 365. With 360-degree views into each profile, sales staff can work remotely without interrupting the customer experience.  

The solution also works with the firm's risk assessment tool to identify vulnerable areas caused by the pandemic, allowing staff to create proactive plans for their clients. The company is keeping their business personal, up-to-date, and resilient by optimizing digital solutions in a time of uncertainty.

This successful pivot clearly highlights the power of Dynamics 365 as an adaptable cloud platform that can not only deliver strategic solutions but also adapt to changing business needs quickly.
