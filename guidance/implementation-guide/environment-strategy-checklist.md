# Environment strategy checklist

Use this article to help you develop and manage your strategy for how to structure environments for a Dynamics 365 implementation project.  

## Organization environment and tenant strategy

- Define environment and tenant strategies and obtain agreement for them at the program level with all key stakeholders, including business, IT, security, and compliance.

- Create a strategy that considers the future growth of the solution.

- Create an environment strategy that can support the application lifecycle management (ALM) processes and necessary automation.

- Create an environment strategy that considers the short and long-term impact on licensing, compliance, application design, performance, scalability, maintainability, and ALM of the solution.

- Create a strategy that considers the potential need for citizen development scenarios or collaborative development with both IT and business users.

- Create an environment planning matrix with key considerations of the pros and cons to help plan and visualize the impact.

## Environment app strategy

- Create an organization environment strategy that defines the guidelines for onboarding more apps.

- Assess the impact on the overall data estate. Avoid excessive fragmentation and promote reuse of existing integrations and data flows.

## Global deployment

- Account for global deployment scenarios; more coordination and agreement may be required to meet regional requirements and compliance needs.

- Assess the latency to choose the optimal locationâ€”global deployments are prone to network latency related performance issues.

## Governance and control

- Establish governance processes for provisioning, monitoring, managing the lifecycle, and decommissioning the environments early on.

- Ensure the different security personas involved in the environment management are understood and appropriately assigned.

- Use the CoE Starter Kit to make necessary adjustments to citizen development use cases as needed because they require further governance consideration.
