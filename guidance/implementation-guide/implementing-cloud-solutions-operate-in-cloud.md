# Operate in the cloud with Dynamics 365

Successfully operating in the cloud drives business value for your organization. Having the right skills and the change management processes aligned to your platform means you're set up to operate smoothly and derive continued value from service updates and enhancements.

## Center of Excellence

You might have a partner and specialized development team assist with the initial deployment. However, once you're back in "business as usual" operations mode, does your team have the skillset to manage the platform. Can they maintain the custom components, and assess and implement appropriate new features?  

Not having the correct level of expertise and guidance onboard after you go live can inhibit solution advancements and undermine your ability to take full advantage of the platform. Creating a Center of Excellence (CoE) within the organization and investing in developing the skills to operate on the platform is valuable. Organizations that embrace organic application development by end users also need a well-established CoE. This center can administer, nurture, govern, and guide users to adopt the citizen development approach to business applications, empowering everyone to create innovative apps with high standards by using a consistent application lifecycle management (ALM) process.

Microsoft provides a CoE starter toolkit that includes prebuilt processes:

- Administer  

  Gain insights into your Power Platform adoption

- Govern  

  Establish audit, compliance, and archive processes

- Nurture  

  Accelerate your adoption with a thriving community

- Drive innovation  

  Pick the most impactful and valuable scenarios for development

- Consistent ALM  

  Apply source control strategies using GitHub

- Standards and theming  

  Create, manage, and share enterprise-branded themes as well as maintain and follow organizational best practices and standards

## Usage and monitoring

Running your business on the cloud means you want the cloud to be always available, responsive, and scalable. You also want to be alerted to unexpected issues in the applications and infrastructure so you can diagnose and fix them. Additionally, you want to comply with SLAs you have in place from other businesses. Having a monitoring capability can prepare your business to meet these objectives.

### What to monitor?

Different personas in your company want to monitor for different aspects of the system. End users may be more concerned with responsiveness, admins may be looking at changes, and the business may be looking at KPIs like the time taken to place an order.

When running a SaaS application, you want to focus on the business, while a service vendor assumes the role of maintaining the solution. As a customer, you still have a level of control over the solution. It's not least important when you have customizations in place to fine-tune the business processes for your organization. If you introduce a new feature in production and it causes unexpected issues, you want to detect it proactively and resolve it before it becomes a problem. Using features and flags to control new features can serve you well in these situations because you can quickly turn off a faulty feature.

A proactive and reactive monitoring strategy that empowers your staff to detect and resolve issues should be part of every customer's arsenal.

### Best practices for monitoring

Keep in mind the following best practices:

- Decide what exactly to monitor, especially the KPIs, and whether the service is meeting them.

- Monitor your consumption, subscription, and services fees. The more cloud services you use, the more they cost.

- Use automation to automatically trigger actions and to alert people when thresholds are reached.

- Track user activities for accountability (including the applications, screens, and features they use), the responsiveness, and the frequency of use.

> For example, you can configure Dynamics 365 and [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to access telemetry and diagnostics data and set up alerts and dashboards to proactively monitor your Dynamics 365 environments.

## Adopt and align to a product roadmap

Your cloud solution evolves and delivers on the promise of digital transformation. It delivers new capabilities that help you stay competitive in your industry. Cloud vendors do their own research and listen to customer feedback to improve the product by adding new features. Being actively engaged in this process by giving feedback, staying abreast of the latest roadmap, and planning for upcoming changes is an effective way to operate in cloud. Also, the key stakeholders from the business need to remain engaged and stay plugged in to new features development, investments, and product direction. We recommend developing your own roadmap for business applications and aligning this to the product direction to get the most out of your investments.

Dynamics 365 has two [release waves](/dynamics365/release-plans/) per year in which several incremental enhancements and new capabilities are made available to customers. Adopting these mandatory changes and new features—many of which are included in existing license plans—are a fundamental aspect of operating in cloud.

## Stay engaged

Implementing the system is one thing, but getting continuous return on investment (ROI) from your cloud solution requires engagement. Companies who stay passionate and curious about the solution and adopt the latest features are the ones who enjoy most success. We urge all customers to maintain engagement through conferences and events throughout the year, and stay connected by using community groups. Customers, partners, and Microsoft engineering have formed several official and unofficial communities. Take every opportunity to influence the product through active engagement with product leaders, advisory boards, table talk with product managers, preview programs, and collaborative development opportunities.

> You can choose from application-specific forums at the [Microsoft Dynamics Community](https://community.dynamics.com/), Yammer groups, blogs, events, and how-to videos where you can discuss ideas, learn features, learn roadmaps, and ask questions.
