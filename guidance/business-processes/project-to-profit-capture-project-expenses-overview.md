# Capture project expenses overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Finance***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to support an organization's requirements to capture project expenses.

## Introduction to capture project expenses

The *Capture project expense* business process area focuses on capturing the expenses associated with a project. A project can incur expenses in different ways, including users recording time for the work performed on the project or expenses that may be incurred related to the project. The *Capture project expenses* business process includes recording and approval of expenses. This business process is an essential step in recording the costs associated with a project. It helps the organization determine the overall health and profitability of the project, both during the project and once it's complete.

Dynamics 365 Project Operations supports the ability to process expenses. Expense processing occurs with or without projects by using a customizable workflow of policies, transaction categories, and approvals. These workflows help ensure that users have captured the appropriate backup information in terms of receipts, details of work performed, and so on.

For project-based organizations, a structured and defined approach to capture expenses is essential to tracking costs in delivering a project. Certain organizations add markup on top of cost to charge to their customers. If costs aren't captured properly, you risk incorrect margins. The *Capture project expenses* business process area should be defined and incorporated into the overall implementation during the planning phase. This phase typically occurs at the beginning of a project's lifecycle. It involves establishing project goals, defining project scope, and developing a detailed plan for project expenses in terms of human resources and expenses.

## Stakeholders 

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Capture project expenses* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Project managers**: Responsible for defining the project expenses at a detailed level based on contracting or internal agreement. Also responsible for ensuring the expenses get captured in the system, approving expenses, and tracking actual versus budgeted expenses.

- **Finance department**: Responsible for financial supervision and financial project reporting and analysis.

- **Executive leadership**: Responsible for project oversight and alignment with an organization's strategic goals and helping to secure the necessary resources and funding.

## Capture project expenses process flow 

The following diagram illustrates the *Capture project expenses* business process area.

1. Start

2. *Project to profit* end-to-end process

3. *Manage project supply chain*

4. *Resource a project*

5. *Capture project expenses*

6. *Define expense policies*

7. *Enter expense*

8. Is expense report approved?

   1. Branch for *Yes* leads to processing of expenses.

   2. Branch for *No* leads to correction of expenses

9. Once expenses are processed, the *process project invoices* business process takes over to raise invoices to the customer.

10. End

## Capture project expenses benefits

There are many key benefits that can be used to monitor and measure the success of implementing technology to support the *Capture project expenses* business process. The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might monitor and measure for *Capture project expenses*. 

### Monitor costs and determine profitability

Capturing expenses for a project allows organizations to determine the total cost of the project and by comparing it with customer billing, organizations can help determine the profitability of their projects at any point of time.

### Support customer billing

Depending upon billing contract with customers, capturing detailed expense (category level) allows organizations to either apply markup or bill actuals. Policy enforcement helps capture the supporting documentation that may be required by customers.

### Budgeting on future projects

Capturing actual expenses when delivering a project helps with baselining the expenses for similar new projects. Having details at category level can help justify the budget for new projects.

### Insights into reducing expenses

By capturing expenses at a detailed level, organizations can understand different expense areas and their associated benefits to the project. They gain insight into which areas can be optimized to achieve better efficiency.
