# Get started

Effective January 1, 2021, customer nominations are required for FastTrack engagements across the Dynamics 365 application suite. Eligible customers can work with their qualified partner or assigned Microsoft account manager, if applicable, to request a FastTrack for Dynamics 365 engagement.

-	[Link to nominate customers (for Microsoft field)](https://aka.ms/D365FTNom)
-	[Link to nominate customers (for partners)](https://aka.ms/ftnomportal)

Once a nomination is submitted, the regional FastTrack for Dynamics 365 lead will evaluate the eligibility and assign the customer to a FastTrack engineering resource. If a nomination does not meet the required eligibility, an exception must be submitted.

Also effective January 1, 2021:

- FastTrack requires that all customers have an implementation partner.  
- FastTrack requires that all implementation partners have the Cloud Business Applications silver or gold competency.
- FastTrack requires that all implementation partners complete the Success by Design training prior to project initiation.

## Exception process
FastTrack exceptions must be granted by the regional leadership team. To request an exception, please reach out to your Microsoft contact for review.
