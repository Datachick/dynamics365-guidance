# Define your requirements

Some projects start with lists of requirements derived as a set of atomic functional requirements. Without reference to mapped and documented business processes, you risk running into issues like the ones we list here:

- Late discovery of missing process steps

- Misinterpretation of the requirement by parties not experts in the related process

- Lower business engagement in the project

- Longer review cycles as the requirements and designs are less clear

Business process mapping helps draw the as-is processes to understand how the business is running right now, and the to-be processes to show how they should work in the future. This approach emphasizes the importance of business process mapping early in the project.

After determining what you keep or build, create the list of requirements, aligning them to the business processes for an accurate picture. You can use tools equipped for the traceability of the requirements.

Typically, in a process-focused solution, once the processes have been defined and agreed upon, the detailed requirements are derived, and relevant designs are mapped. There are tools within Dynamics 365 to help with managing the requirements. For example, Azure DevOps can work to create and track requirements. Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services also includes Business Process Modeler (BPM) that can help you establish and implement processes.

The list of requirements is easier to be crafted starting from the business process mapping and can be iteratively revised and refined.

## A solution that helps you operate your business

It's not an easy task to design and build a solution that has a great positive impact. You must consider many aspects. Everything is so connected that even if you miss just a small piece, it might influence the whole project.  

The business process flows are the common playground where we gather all the implementation artifacts. They keep all the solution components and phases aligned and connect the dots. Business process flows are the main instrument for communication that helps to drive changes on how the business runs and helps to minimize missing those small pieces.

Business processes are involved during the entire journey of implementation and remain useful for future improvements in your business. They have a perpetual impact on your business, as long as they're continuously revised to align to the business goals and vision and any changes are reflected in the solution.

By defining business process flows, you prepare a fertile ground to plant the seed for all the implementation activities. And at the end, you can harvest optimized and efficient processes, risk depletion, cost minimization, role compliance, integral solution, and a successful implementation.
