# Opportunity for optimization

It's easier to find good opportunities to optimize your process using business process mapping.

## Mapping processes

Processes are the heart of every business. They describe how the business operates. The fact that your products or services reach your customer safely and on time is due to a series of tasks executed by different roles and different business units. Business process mapping represents these steps.

Baseline business processes are also called *as-is processes*. The organization might have legacy processes, or maybe they have new processes engineered as part of a new solution or business model. Find tips on how to start mapping your *as-is processes* in existing templates from recognized organizations such as [American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC)](https://www.apqc.org/expertise/process-performance-management). Such information could be helpful to set the structure of your processes.

Regardless of where an as-is process set comes from, it's critical that they're described at the appropriate level. Keeping as-is processes at a more abstract level helps drive the scenarios in scope and enables the team to focus on the desired business outcomes. As-is processes that are detailed about how current implementations are in legacy systems introduce a risk of reimplementing the legacy system.

Remember that the objective of as-is business process mapping isn't to define step-by-step how the solution is designed in the new solution.

The goal of mapping the as-is business process is to:

- Provide structure/skeleton for the definition of the scope of the project.

- Express the project aims in the natural business language of processes.

- Enable a natural way to define the main end-to-end business scenarios (process variants).

- Provide the best language to identify and highlight areas for process innovation and improvements, as well as risks and constraints.

- Become the basis for mapping to the equivalent process design within the new system.

- Create a workable definition of the project that the business can directly interact with without going to the level of individually written requirements.

The value of having business processes mapped early is that it allows everyone to understand how the processes operate by using them as a common business language. This helps both third parties and the organization agree on processes across multiple departments and organization layers.  

It's essential that the right team is involved in mapping business processes to the new technology. The business stakeholder leads this team, and they're the owner of the process in the business operation. That individual is charged with making the right decisions about structure and investment in the process to achieve their goals.  

The stakeholder is supported by one or more subject matter experts (SME) who are familiar with how the business process operates in the real world. These experts can provide depth around the various scenarios under which a process is executed. Their knowledge, coupled with a mindset open to new ways of working, helps drive the right conversation on process mapping.

As an example, a company is looking to move to a B2B business model via e-commerce and seeks to deploy their telephone salespeople strictly to consumers. There may not be existing patterns within the business to replicate, so the new processes should be based on expected outcomes rather than copying legacy steps. This mindset should be applied to all processes, as the key deliverables should be the expected "business scenarios" and the desired business outcomes.

When reviewing new process diagrams, the team should consider the following:

- Do the business SMEs recognize their business in the processes?

- Do they provide adequate coverage of the business activities in scope?

- Do they show the key interconnections between the processes?

- Do they show meaningful end-to-end business flows?

- Will they represent a good level at which the project team can communicate with business stakeholders on risks, progress, decisions, and actions?

- Do they illustrate processes sufficiently to identify opportunities for improvement?

- Are they sufficiently well-defined to be able to be used in the next stage where the processes can be applied to drive the design in the Dynamics 365 system such that they can reflect the improvements and the project goals and vision?

These process diagrams help define the baseline for the organization's current business and are a good place to start when plotting optimization objectives. They should help to identify the processes or parts of processes that aren't efficient or well understood.

The key to getting the processes mapped well and quickly is to make sure that the following requirements are true:

- The right people are in the room to direct the mapping.

- Any mapping software or tools that help facilitate the rapid definition of the process and don't slow things down.

- The level to which the process is described is directly proportional to its importance to the business. For example, once the end-to-end scope of a widely used and standard finance process is defined to a certain level it shouldn't be further broken down to step-by-step processes.

- The process mapping effort is interactive, not a series of documents that go through long handoffs and approvals.

- The tools for the mapping can be anything from sticky notes, Visio diagrams, or specialized process drawing software. The process maps are visual and not hidden in wordy Excel lists.

This is a vital step that needs to be executed early. Plan so that processes are defined as fast as possible using the simplest tools in the workshop, like sticky notes, pens, and whiteboards. The drawings and comments can then be transferred offline to more sophisticated applications.

Remember that doing this mapping at the start of the project implementation is important. It could become a fundamental part of helping the analysis of the opportunities for process improvement and creating the right baseline for the project.

Mapping business process is a not one-time effort that occurs only during the initial implementation. Rather, it should be a continuous focus to ensure the processes are aligned to the evolving needs of a business and are making the best use of the latest capabilities in the product.

## Modeling your solution for the future

Digital transformation is fast paced. Processes that work today may not remain competitive tomorrow. Technologies like the cloud, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, virtual reality, the Internet of Things, big data, virtual conference rooms, and many others create possibilities that didn't exist a few years ago.

When reviewing your business processes, it's important to keep in mind how innovative technologies can improve process outcomes and collaboration. Similarly, there may be multiple areas in your processes that would benefit from modern options now available. Technology is a key differentiator. Remember, chances are that your competitors may well be considering these options and looking to incorporate them.

For example, the Microsoft HoloLens is being introduced to some manufacturing processes with Dynamics 365 applications. Using the HoloLens, the user can understand how to operate a machine. Or if a machine is broken, and support is on the other side of the world, virtual reality enables collaboration between the user and support to repair the machine.

Or if you have a workflow with approvals that require a signature, you could use digital signature technology to drive process efficiency and reduce the time for approvals.

## Standardize your system's features with a business processes approach

Earlier, we discussed how a business model analysis can introduce opportunities for process reengineering and standardization.

Assuming there's a good plan for process standardization grounded in the business strategy, this standardization can be aided with a new business applications system.

Standardization across business units assumes that the business models are sufficiently similar and there are no local market constraints or competitive reasons for there to be differences.

Various benefits can come from standardized processes assuming the business models are sufficiently similar between the business units so that the other barriers to standardization are low.

- Enables reduction in cost by reducing the variations of business processes that need to be implemented, trained, and maintained.

- Facilitates comparative analysis across multiple groups of users that are executing the same process.

- Facilitates mobility of resources within the organization through standard processes to deal with changes in demand.

- Promotes the adoption of best practices across the organizations. Optimization for anyone improves outcomes for everyone.

Standardization also helps with rolling out the implementation to other business units as it reduces the time and effort compared to building a process from scratch. After the first implementation, there's a proven case of it working within the business. The next business unit to be implemented can discuss the pros and cons of the standard process with business peers.

Similarly, it's important to confirm that the constraints and implications are identified and well understood prior to starting design work.

- Standardization of a process can bring benefits at a group level, but may be seen as more work by a local business unit.

- Standardization can require significant change management.

- Is the standardization being defined at an industry level and then implemented in the system? Conflict might arise if standard processes aren't a natural fit with Dynamics 365.

- Will the process be designed in Dynamics 365? And will these processes become the new standard?

- Is the entire end-to-end process to be standardized or will there be areas and functions for local variations? If so, does that align with the standard capabilities in Dynamics, or could it need customizations?

- Does the business case for standardization remain sufficiently strong after all the constraints and implications are balanced against the benefits?

In multiple, phased rollouts, process standardization often takes the shape of a "core template" with the expectation of rolling out this "template" to subsequent business units.

Creating process maps is essential to identifying the opportunities and to realizing the potential benefits outlined previously. The use of the common business language of processes is the vital mechanism that brings all of these aspects into focus.
