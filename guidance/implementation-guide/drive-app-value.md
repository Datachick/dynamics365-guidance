# Drive app value

This article outlines the approach to digital transformation and discusses strategies on how to shorten the time to value, cut through the noise, and focus on business outcomes with Dynamics 365.

In the constantly evolving world of cloud applications and changing business needs, it's important that your business applications evolve and are consistently delivering value. Solutions with Dynamics 365 run in the cloud, often as software as a service (SaaS), and fully support the changes of the modern world.  

The digital transformation journey of an organization usually involves various phases and levels of maturity. A green field implementation could start with a pilot or even a minimum viable product (MVP) targeted at a specific business process, then incrementally expand the solution with more capabilities for the users and onboard new business processes.

Alternatively, replacing an existing system could mean that a significant amount of functionality needs to be made available at the start in order to have parity. No matter where you start, realizing the long-term goals of a SaaS-based digital transformation requires effective planning.

In this section, we explore how to create a digital transformation roadmap for your organization. The roadmap can help accelerate the time to value while maintaining relevance in a constantly changing technology and business landscape. This guide can help you navigate the challenges of expanding your solution and drive continuous, long-term business value through digital transformation.
