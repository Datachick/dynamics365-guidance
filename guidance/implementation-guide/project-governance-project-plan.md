# Project plan for Dynamics 365 implementation projects

Project plan analysis is where the outcomes of many aspects of project governance become visible. The effects of good governance are felt on a project by noting that the project plan is resilient to the smaller changes and unknowns that are a reality for all business application projects. Poor governance, on the other hand, manifests itself as continuously missed targets, unreliable delivery, and repeated baselining (pushing back) of the project plan milestones. The key is for the project planning process to have its own governance mechanisms to avoid poor practices, detect risks early, and provide the agility and insights to fix and adjust quickly.

## Key questions to cover

When determining how the project plan should be constructed, the project plan should be able to demonstrate the following questions:

- **Is the project plan designed to cover all the critical areas?**

  Does the plan cover (at least at a milestone level) all the key areas of activity? If not, it misses key dependencies and effort.

- **Is the project plan actionable?**

  A project plan should be able to fulfill one if its primary purposes of directing a project. If that isn't the reality on the project, you should look at how to restructure it so that it's the main driver of project activity at least at the milestone level.

  If a plan is thousands of lines long, it's unlikely to be directly actionable, and it's  probably in a state of continuous update and adjustment.

  Similarly, if the project workstreams aren't paying any attention to the plan, it's a clear sign that the project plan may not be actionable. Actionable project plans help direct the project teams to deliver the right activity at the right time and reduce uncontrolled activities.

  Agile projects might use some form of prioritized backlog management for much of the build and test activities. But there's still a high-level milestone plan to allow for the communication and management of related tasks that aren't in the backlog.

  Whatever methodology is in place, the plan should be regularly evaluated to confirm that the teams are taking their direction from the plan.

- **Is the project plan up to date, accurate, and realistic?**

  Compared with the traditional on-premises business application projects of a few years ago, today's cloud-based Dynamics 365 implementations tend to move faster with shorter durations. A project plan that isn't up to date is ineffective.

  Projects should institute thresholds for how out of date a project plan is allowed to become. A project plan that is inaccurate in terms of the estimated effort (and remaining effort), duration, and dependencies promote the wrong decisions. These project plans allow risks to remain hidden, and ultimately give an inaccurate picture of the project status.

  For a project plan to remain accurate, it needs a robust task estimation process and a reliable and easy means of tracking tasks in progress. Consider how to make it possible structurally and with efficient processes.

- **Does the project plan give a clear indication of what tasks are critical?**

  Business application projects have many moving parts and many specialist areas. The project must be able to accurately derive the critical path so that project leadership can focus their attention on those tasks. For agile projects, agile crews prioritizing the backlog and managing the critical path within short-duration sprints and iterations can provide the necessary insight.

## Accountability for outcomes

Project planning should promote the clear identification of accountability for the outcomes (both at the workstream level and overall). Often, projects create a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) matrix at the start of the project, but this may not provide the right level of accountability for all areas. Additionally, this matrix isn't always referenced during the project implementation. Asking the question via the project plan if the accountability for the outcome (not responsibility) is clear, helps keep the accountability fresh in everyone's mind. It keeps the project more agile with faster decision-making.

## Status reporting

A well-constructed project plan facilitates accurate project status reporting. However, it needs to be deliberately designed into the project plan with the right dependencies, estimated effort, and milestones so it can be easily extracted from the plan. This means that the project should be deliberate in the detail to which tasks are scheduled so dependencies and milestones are created with this in mind. Because status reporting often has milestone-level status as a key indicator, the meaning of a milestone's completion must be explicitly defined so the implications are clear to the intended audience.

Project plans also need a regular and easy-to-use process to keep task progress updated with an accurate status. You should also define a uniform and reliable method for units of progress so you get the same quality of updates from all teams. For example, when tasks are marked as 80 percent complete, the project often under-estimates the effort to complete the remaining 20 percent. Instead, consider reporting the remaining effort in hours for a given task.

Some projects, especially agile projects, use alternative or other analysis and presentation methods such as a backlog burndown, remaining cost to complete, or earned value. But these principles apply nevertheless, and they all rely on having accurate underlying data on actual versus expected progress to date and the remaining effort expected.

A useful way to report the status of a business application project is to present a functional heatmap view that shows the readiness of the key processes for the next major milestone. For example, sprint reviews, SIT, UAT, or go-live. The functional heatmap is a business process perspective of the project plan status.

Status reports can also include status from other project controls such as risks and issues, sentiment surveys, or resource availability in prior months. These aren't directly derived from a project plan and can provide a useful supplementary view. However, it's important to ensure that actionable conclusions are extracted from these alternative views. These conclusions should generate tasks that can be measured, planned, allocated, and then reflected at some level in the project plan.

## Project feedback loop

Project status should provide a feedback loop to the project stakeholders, project management, and the project team to adjust the project based on the findings. This should be a defined process in the overall project governance to create the discipline to regularly review the status and generate explicit actions for the project that directly address the status findings.

The project status shouldn't be the only source for this feedback loop; consider all the other controls and procedures in the project that can generate actionable information to establish a systematic mechanism defined to diligently listen and extract the actions. For example, updates from daily stand-ups, design reviews, sprint playbacks, or even informal risk discussions can help provide useful feedback.

In summary, create a culture from your governance processes that actively recognizes the feedback loop and translates feedback into actions.
