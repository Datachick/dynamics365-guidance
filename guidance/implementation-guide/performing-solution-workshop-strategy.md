# FastTrack performance workshop

[Microsoft FastTrack](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/) offers a workshop that focuses on designing your solution for performance. It covers the effect of configuration and customization on the solution's overall performance and user experience, and emphasizes the importance of performance prioritization, goals, and testing throughout the project.

## Workshop scope

The workshop includes the following subjects that address how to incorporate performance activities into the overall delivery plan and allocate sufficient resources to the project:

- Data volumes: Project workload and integration volumes to make sure expectations are within limits and aligned with intended product usage.
- Geolocation strategy: Determine the physical locations of users and servers to identify any network-related challenges.
- Key business scenarios: Identity the areas of the business for which performance is particularly important.
- Extension performance: Review planned customizations to understand how implementation aligns with recommended practices.
- User experience performance: Make sure that modifications to the user experience align with best practices.
- Performance testing: Develop and document performance-related goals and a testing strategy to measure performance.

## Timing

We recommend that you conduct the performance workshop before solution design begins. Alternatively, do it as soon as possible after the team can provide detailed information about performance requirements and the performance testing strategy. Scheduling a workshop later in the implementation is risky because any findings and recommendations from the workshop could cause significant rework.
