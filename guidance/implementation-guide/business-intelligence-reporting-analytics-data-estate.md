# The data estate and data modernization

A data estate refers to the infrastructure that helps organizations manage all their data, regardless of where or how it is stored. The massive growth in data and the increasing need for immediate insights demand a fast, agile, accessible, secure, and highly scalable data platform.

Organizations typically used legacy applications to both store data and serve as the interface for data collection. Data modernization restructures how data is collected, stored, and managed to take advantage of innovative technology, and is backed by AI and data analytics solutions that optimize the data-review process. Organizations seeking improved business performance must design and manage their data estate based on a modern platform that breaks the data silos and unleashes the data's full potential.

## Build a data strategy

For business solutions to deliver the intended results, an organization's data strategy must articulate a clear vision that effectively aligns business intelligence investments with business goals to maximize impact, drive growth, and improve profitability.

To define your data strategy, start with the business questions you need to answer to meet your organization's goal of using the data to make more effective decisions that improve the business outcome.

With customers now having access to more information and channels, an organization's data strategy should reflect the customer journey. From a data management perspective, all channels and checkpoints across the customer journey should be represented.

> [!TIP]
> A common risk for businesses is the quality of their data. If data is weak, unstructured, unsecured, or difficult to use or access, additional work will be required to move, scrub, protect, and improve the quality of the data. Poor data quality also can lead to lost opportunities, failure to consistently attract customers, increased time and expense for cleaning data or processing corrections, and inaccurate or inconsistent KPI measurements.

## Modernize your data estate

Your data estate modernization strategy should map the current data estate, goals, business processes, and regulatory requirements to aid gap analysis of the existing and desired future state. It should identify key analytics and metrics to improve the business and effectively align business intelligence investments with business goals.

Cloud-based solutions offer modern capabilities based on machine learning and AI to analyze portions of data and automate other processes, such as identifying and solving data quality issues. In terms of analysis, prebuilt models can serve the most common use cases, eliminating the need to build custom models.

> [!TIP]
> Some organizations emphasize collecting data more than analyzing it to drive insights. It's also important to identify gaps and blockers for business objectives and outcomes, and not focus solely on the data, structure, analytics, tools, or technologies.

> [!TIP]
> Implementing or investing in sustaining legacy solutions brings the risk of a future gap. AI and machine learning solutions take a modern approach to data and analytics that grows as technology evolves, making it possible for organizations to add new features and capabilities in the future—and reduce the risk of being outperformed by competitors.

## The modern data estate and the digital feedback loop

[Gartner, Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3976035/predicts-2020-data-and-analytics-strategies-invest-influ) predicted in 2020 that investments in data and analytics strategies will critically affect businesses in the years ahead.

How organizations modernize their data estate is influenced by the four data signals found in the [digital feedback loop](business-intelligence-reporting-analytics-overview.md#break-the-silos-and-use-the-digital-feedback-loop). <!-- <T.G.

### Empower people

To do their jobs more efficiently, employees need tools and resources, as well as timely access to information. Utilizing AI to further automate business processes contributes to better and faster results, which then empowers your people <!-- <T.G. Reference to figure not needed(Figure 13-2), added graphic on top--> to make the best decisions and deliver value to customers.

### Engage customers

Modern applications are already capable of delivering insights by using AI and data analytics to optimize business processes and shed light on customer activity. For example, Dynamics 365 apps can provide a customer service agent with insights into a customer's interests and purchasing behavior information in real time, allowing the agent to make suggestions tailored to the customer. These types of insights help businesses intelligently engage customers <!-- <T.G. Reference to figure not needed(Figure 13-2)--> to provide a superior customer service experience.

### Transform products (and services)

Products and services have become sources of data that provide better insights into lifecycle-related information that can be used to benefit organizations and their customers. By analyzing those insights, organizations can in turn transform their products and services <!-- <T.G. Reference to figure not needed (Figure 13-2)--> to take advantage of opportunities and expand into new channels and markets. For example, a smart air conditioner that allows you to set an optimal temperature via an app can also apply what it learns about your household's daily routine to make sure the house is cool when everyone gets home. The air conditioner's manufacturer then uses data collected from all users to enhance the product's smart features, leading to a continuous improvement cycle.

### Optimize operations

Cloud-based AI usage is an increasingly common investment area for most organizations—and not just for customer-facing technology. For example, Dynamics 365 for Field Service can use AI to anticipate hardware failures on a manufacturing floor and automatically dispatch technicians before the malfunction. Organizations that optimize their operations <!-- <T.G. Reference to figure not needed (Figure 13-2)--> with augmented analytics, AI, and embedded intelligence will be more competitive in the marketplace.
