# Stay evergreen with Dynamics 365 online

One of the benefits of a modern cloud solution is that every customer runs on the latest version of the service. It's the only model that scales, and it also applies to Dynamics 365 online. With this approach, every security patch, bug fix, performance enhancement, and functional improvement accrues to all implementations across the globe. Microsoft assumes responsibility for keeping the platform current. It means that you no longer have to pull large teams of people together every few years to perform a traditional upgrade over many weeks or months with limited added value for the business. The evergreen approach and the model of continuous updates gives your business access to the latest capabilities to stay ahead of the competition and meet changing customer expectations.

Dynamics 365 has embraced this approach of operating on one version in a way that delivers benefits without disruption. The improvements and enhancements embrace the CI/CD model, with service updates delivered on a weekly basis, but these changes aren't targeted at the end user experience. You can take advantage of release waves to preview upcoming changes and test and prepare your users before the changes are deployed.

Achieving the right balance of delivering improvements and business capabilities in a safe manner without disrupting the user experience is paramount to our evergreen cloud approach.

The article [Service the solution](service-solution.md) delves further into the updates wave approach.
