# Project governance conclusion for Dynamics 365 implementation projects

The primary intention at the start of this section was to provide an overview of the importance of good project governance and provide guidance on how to assess the effectiveness of your existing or proposed governance model.

We then moved on to describe how many of the critical issues on a Dynamics 365 project that initially may manifest themselves as technical issues actually have their roots in failures of project governance. We also saw that the governance requirements for a Dynamics 365 business application need to address the fact that the project is essentially delivering the capability to perform business processes using the application. So, the governance model must include strategies and techniques that can help realize the project goals through the right engagement with business users and business processes.

We discussed how defining a project organization model that has an engaged leadership and facilitates rapid and accurate communication is more aware of the reality of the project. Similarly, project organizations that enable the right accountability, naturally encourage cross-collaboration, and reflect the complexity and effort of the project are much more likely to have good velocity and be successful.

We also discussed how the approach is more than a technical methodology, and that the approach must be practical and tailored to the specific needs of a Dynamics 365 business application and to the customer's project and business needs and constraints.

We showed that the mere presence of the usual governance structures doesn't assure project success. We can evaluate the effectiveness of the governance model in practical ways and with a focus on the specific needs of Dynamics 365 projects.

We also brought awareness to how a governance perspective on the specific technical implementation strategies (such as test and build strategies) can help a Dynamics 365 project achieve better, faster results. We proposed that governance should be an organic part of the strategy. These strategies shouldn't be considered as being purely subject to technical oversight and control.

Lastly, we discussed how a good project plan and planning process expose the outcomes of many these governance areas. Project planning shouldn't just be an overall status reporting tool, but be deliberately engineered to gain early and deep insights into the effectiveness of the different elements of the project work and allow rapid responses to the deficiencies.

You can use the key objectives of good project governance to judge the overall suitability of a given governance model. Ideally, you should test a proposed governance model against these objectives during the Initiate phase of the project and throughout, but it's never too late.

In summary, project governance for Dynamics 365 projects should be a framework that permeates all aspects of our projects, not just the typical areas that were historically or conventionally regarded as the domain of governance. Good project governance isn't a set of generalized bureaucratic or administrative procedures to follow, it's about creating a Dynamics 365-specific governance culture of driving the project to reliably and efficiently deliver the project goals.
