# Onboard a Dynamics 365 project without FastTrack nomination

Effective January 1, 2021, Dynamics 365 customers with an annual revenue of more than $100,000 must be nominated for FastTrack. See [Get started](get-started-overview.md) for more information. For customers not nominated to FastTrack, light-touch implementation guidance will be provided.  

## Implementation project

You can onboard your organization as self-service in Lifecycle Services if you're not nominated for FastTrack. Learn more at [LCS workspace for the current versions of the finance and operations apps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs#lcs-workspace-for-the-current-versions-of-the-finance-and-operations-apps) in the Lifecycle Services content.  

After the Implementation project workspace is provisioned in Lifecycle Services, the Microsoft FastTrack team will monitor your onboarding progress. If project onboarding is not completed within a few weeks after creating a Lifecycle Services implementation project, a reminder will be sent to the project team. It's important that the project onboarding in Lifecycle Services is completed with the most accurate date, and that the email addresses listed in the setup are monitored. For more information, see [Project onboarding](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/project-onboarding) in the Lifecycle Services content.
