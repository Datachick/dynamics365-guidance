# Implement cloud solutions with Dynamics 365

In this section of the Dynamics 365 implementation guidance, we discuss cloud implementation and considerations for upgrading from on-premises to the cloud, including customizations and operating in the cloud. We talk about why organizations must adopt a cloud mindset, especially when they’ve been running on-premises applications for years. We also explore the importance of focusing on business value, data as an asset, and automation.  

*The cloud* is the constellation of connected servers, data warehouses, and associated software and services. And it's at the core of a digital transformation strategy.

Organizations of all sizes recognize that the cloud is the fastest way to modernize their operations to increase efficiency while better serving customers. For many organizations, the shift to the cloud simply means running their applications in a public cloud infrastructure instead of the traditional on-premises datacenter. Other organizations employ a cloud model (Software as a Service, SaaS) that uses cloud applications and an underlying cloud platform to accelerate a business focused transformation with greater agility to adapt to future changes.

Whatever model an organization chooses, we find that the key to success isn't just what implementation looks like. Rather, it's how leaders, architects, and organizations approach the digital transformation journey. Success in the cloud isn't just about the technology or the features available—it's about the organizational mindset. For a successful digital transformation, your organization must prepare for changes that span the entire enterprise, including organizational structure, processes, people, culture, and leadership. It's as much a leadership and change exercise as it is a technical exercise.

In this section, we provide a perspective on what to expect when implementing your cloud solution based on Dynamics 365. We introduce principles relevant to any online application. Concepts introduced here are elaborated on in other sections. We hope these principles help you set your course and guide you in your leap into the cloud.

We start by addressing [how to develop a cloud mindset](implementing-cloud-solutions-adopt-cloud-mindset.md) in an organization, which is foundational to your digital transformation. Then we delve into factors to consider and understand before you shift to a shared public cloud from an [on-premises setup](implementing-cloud-solutions-upgrade-from-onpremises-to-cloud.md). For example, how the shift impacts controls you have in place, and how to think differently about scalability, performance, shared resources, and more. After that, we discuss the principles around [customization and extending cloud apps](implementing-cloud-solutions-customize-extend-cloud-applications.md). Finally, we explore [the operating model](implementing-cloud-solutions-operate-in-cloud.md), always up-to date [evergreen cloud models](implementing-cloud-solutions-evergreen-cloud.md), and the options to [migrate](implementing-cloud-solutions-upgrade-from-onpremises-to-cloud.md) to the Dynamics 365 cloud from on-premises.

Embracing SaaS applications to run your business can significantly accelerate your digital transformation. But it's also important to recognize that organizational cloud maturity plays a significant role in your strategy's long-term success.

Organizations working on their first major implementation in the cloud should expect some level of disruption to the existing ways of deploying and managing applications. We hope these articles serve as a primer for [Success by Design thinking](success-by-design.md) by setting the context for the changes you can expect and driving you towards greater cloud maturity.
