# Checklist for implementing cloud solutions

## Adopt a cloud mindset

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Look to transform business processes by using SaaS based applications and capabilities that provide value to the business process immediately and provide a path for continuous improvement.|
|&check;|Avoid implementing cloud based processes that are designed based on the recreation of legacy on-premises user experiences.|
|&check;|Have a shared understanding at every level, from the executive sponsor to the developers, of the business impact being delivered.|
|&check;|Ensure the organization has done its due diligence organizing the data estate and understands the impact of the new solution on the data estate.|
|&check;|Gain approval for the cloud platform for use with the appropriate application data category from information security and compliance.|
|&check;|Make sure the respective teams understand all administrative, operational, support, and monitoring aspects of the platform. Also make sure the organization's policies, processes, and patterns conform to the cloud.|
|&check;|Implement DevOps and CI/CD pipelines to support automation for build, testing, and deployment.|
|&check;|Design the solution according to service boundaries and available licensing capacity, and ensure the controls to further expand and scale the solution are understood.|
|&check;|Design the solution to meet the nonfunctional requirements, considering factors like network latency, end-user environment, and devices.|
|&check;|When upgrading existing on-premises solutions to cloud, make sure that the data model, design, and data quality form a stepping stone. Don't stifle cloud adoption by carrying over poor design and data.|

## Customize and extend

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Understand the expected value of each application extension and quantifiable impact on aspects of the business process. For example, data-driven decision making, efficiency, automation, and ease of adoption.|
|&check;|Create guidelines for when to customize and extend out-of-the-box apps and only adopt documented extension techniques.|
|&check;|Avoid deviations and repurposing the out-of-the-box tables and data models (Common Data Model). if you don't, you risk inhibiting future adoption of new features and capabilities.|

## Operation

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Ensure that the necessary expertise is available via the partner (system integrator) or internal teams post-deployment to support and evolve the solution.|
|&check;|Engage with the community to keep up with the latest innovation and help influence the product direction using channels, events, blogs, and other mediums.|
