This article introduces the *product and service lifecycle* management end-to-end business process. It outlines how Dynamics 365 products can help organizations manage and optimize their *product and service lifecycle* management processes.

## Product and service lifecycle management overview

*Product and service lifecycle* management is the process of managing a product or service from its inception to its eventual end of life. The process typically begins with the development of a product or service offering idea, which is then refined and tested to ensure it meets customer needs. Once the product or service is launched, it is important to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments to keep it competitive in the marketplace. As the product matures, it may be necessary to update or refresh the design to maintain customer interest. Eventually, the product may reach the end of its useful life, and it will be retired from the market. Throughout this process, lifecycle management requires careful attention to customer needs, market trends, and technological advancements to ensure the product remains relevant and successful.

In the case of engineering type products which are common in the manufacturing industry, the *product and service lifecycle management* process may involve managing complex bills of materials (BOM) or formulas. A BOM or formula lists all the parts and components that go into a product, and their relationships to each other. Managing the BOM requires careful attention to ensure that all components are available and in the correct quantities, while also taking into account lead times, availability, and cost. Some organizations may offer products that are variable or configurable. In this case the product configurator in Dynamics 365 may be used to allow customers to select specific features and options for a product. The options a customer select can dynamically update and control the BOM.

For retail organizations, the *product and service lifecycle* management process can also involve merchandising. That's the process of selecting and presenting products to customers in a way that maximizes sales. It may include designing product packaging, creating promotional materials, and managing inventory levels to ensure that products are available when customers want them. Dynamics 365 Commerce includes a variety of features to help support the process of enhancing product information with attributes, categorizing products for easy navigation on a website, and relating products to each other. For example, up sell and cross sell products, AI to analyze product other customers purchased to suggest products, and so on. Effective product and lifecycle management requires collaboration between multiple teams, including engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and sales, to ensure that the product is successful throughout its lifecycle.

Every organization has variations to the *product and service lifecycle* management. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization looking to implement a technology solution to support the *product and service lifecycle* management.

## Impact

The *product and service lifecycle* management process can have a significant impact on an organization's overall operations and effectiveness. A well-designed process can help organizations to streamline product development, improve collaboration between teams, and ultimately deliver high-quality products to market faster.

By managing the entire product lifecycle in a single system such as Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, organizations can reduce errors and delays caused by manual data entry or communication breakdowns between teams. This can lead to more efficient product development cycles, as teams can quickly access and share product information, identify issues, and make necessary changes.

Moreover, the tools and features available in Dynamics 365 can help organizations to better understand their products, their components, and their performance throughout their lifecycle. This can help organizations to identify opportunities for cost savings, process improvements, and optimization of resources. By analyzing product data, organizations can gain insights into how to improve product design.

The *product and service lifecycle* management process can help organizations to improve their agility and responsiveness to changing market needs. With real-time visibility into product development and supply chain operations, organizations can quickly pivot to adjust to changes in customer demand, market trends, or supply chain disruptions.

By identifying potential issues early in the product development cycle, organizations can take corrective action before issues impact product quality or customer satisfaction. This can help organizations to avoid costly product recalls or damage to their reputation.

## Stakeholders

The implementation of Dynamics 365 to support the *product and service lifecycle* management process requires involvement from multiple stakeholders across the organization. Below are some of the key stakeholders that should be involved in the implementation:

- **Executive Sponsor**  

  An executive sponsor should be responsible for overall project governance, providing strategic direction, and ensuring that the project is aligned with the organization's goals.

- **IT Team**  

  The IT team will be responsible for implementing the system and ensuring that it is properly configured, integrated with other systems, and maintained. They will also need to ensure that the system is secure and that data is properly managed.

- **Business Process Owners**  

  Business process owners should be involved in defining and optimizing the business processes that will be supported by the system. They will also be responsible for ensuring that the system meets the needs of the business and that users are properly trained.

- **Product Development Teams**  

  Product development teams will be responsible for creating and managing product data, including BOMs, formulas, product configurations, and other related data.

- **Merchandising Teams**  

  The merchandising team is responsible for managing product assortments, product placement, and pricing strategies to drive sales and profitability. They will need to ensure that the system is properly configured to support their needs, including product categorization, product hierarchy, pricing rules, and promotions management.

- **Manufacturing and Supply Chain Teams**  

  Manufacturing and supply chain teams will be responsible for managing the production and delivery of products. They will need to ensure that the system is properly integrated with manufacturing and supply chain systems and that data is properly managed.

- **Sales and Marketing Teams**  

  Sales and marketing teams will be responsible for creating and managing sales data, including pricing, promotions, and other related data. They will also need to ensure that the system is properly integrated with customer relationship management systems.

- **Quality Control Teams**  

  Quality control teams will be responsible for ensuring that products meet quality standards and that issues are identified and resolved. They will need to ensure that the system is properly integrated with quality control systems and that data is properly managed.

In summary, the involvement of multiple stakeholders is critical for the successful implementation of Dynamics 365 to support the *product and service lifecycle* management process. A cross-functional approach is needed to ensure that the system is properly configured, integrated, and optimized to meet the needs of the business.
