# Drive expansion

All the approaches and techniques we have discussed in other articles can help you create an effective digital transformation roadmap for your business application. They're relevant to the *Initiate* phase, but you can apply these methods iteratively or revisit them for further expansion. In this article, we focus on expanding the usage and scope of business applications in different areas to drive even greater business impact. We consider the impact on the following aspects:

- Security and compliance

- Application lifecycle management (ALM)

- Administration and governance

- User readiness and change management

- Environment strategy

- Limits and capacity

- Data and integrations

## Users

The most common expansion scenario for a business solution is adding more users. It might be the result of onboarding new regions or countries onto the same application. User-only expansion sounds straightforward, but you could have data migrations on a live system, security and compliance challenges based on the region, or other impacts.

## Mobile

It can help with adoption that users have access to multiple devices with offline capabilities. In some cases, mobile access is part of the initial release, for example in warehousing systems where goods must be scanned when picked up. In other cases, it could be a subsequent update. Most out-of-the-box capabilities work in mobile apps, with more optimizations to support the move experience. Our example sales mobile application offers the core sales application features with mobile experiences for field sellers.

## Incremental changes

Incremental changes are primarily driven through the feedback and change requests from users and the business. These changes help make sure that the application meets the expectation of ongoing enhancement and continues to build on top of the initial MVP to maintain relevance. It's still important to look at these requests through the business value and transformation lens.

## Feature adoption

As we have seen when discussing change streams, cloud products make significant investments in researching and implementing business capabilities that their customers can easily enable. It's a key value proposition of the cloud, and can play a key role in deriving value from your investments. With continuous updates in Dynamics 365, new features are made available to customers. A key business as usual (BAU) activity is the business analysis of the new features with an analysis of the technical impact on the existing solution and customizations. This activity must be conducted in collaboration with key stakeholders. Most of these feature improvements are made available to customers with no extra cost and can help advance your application to the innovative or differentiator quadrant.

## New workloads

Dynamics 365 provides several business applications that are built on the same scalable power platform. As end users adopt your application, you find more opportunities to onboard related workloads that could help eliminate data siloes by enabling stronger collaboration and data sharing. For example, to achieve seamless collaboration when you're onboarding a marketing workload in addition to sales, the sales team can get visibility into the nurture programs their customers are part of, extend invite to marketing events, and so on. Similarly, the accounts payable team could expand and move into a centralized accounts payable processing system. However, new workloads can have significant impact.

## Satellite applications

When deployed, your business application covers core use cases and scenarios, some of which may only be relevant to a specific team, region, or role. In such scenarios, you can deliver such targeted capabilities via a satellite application. Satellite apps are a good opportunity for user-developed apps and automations while using the data model of the core application. You could also use these applications for incubation before incorporating it in the core app. Regarding areas of impact, it's important to have strong governance around the data model and creation of more data stores, which can lead to data fragmentation.

## Integrations

Integrations can play a key role in eliminating data duplication and improving data quality. Most importantly, they reduce the need for users to navigate multiple applications, which prevents context switching. The core integrations should be part of the initial phases and not be left to future expansion phases. Even the out-of-the-box integrations with existing productivity applications like Microsoft 365 can positively influence adoption and make the information seamlessly available across apps while enabling stronger collaboration. However, you need an abundance of caution. Integration can also lead to performance issues and increase the overall complexity and cost of maintenance, so using the right patterns and practices is critical.

## Aggregation

Aggregation can help consolidate multiple business applications with significant overlap of data and processes into a single application. Aggregation is different from integration, it completely replaces the application and brings the core feature set into an existing application instead of exchanging or embedding information. For example, a commercial banking sales system could become an aggregator for all nonpersonal banking sales systems.

The cutover approach for old applications is critical; make sure to avoid parallel usage leading to fragmentation of data and other aftereffects.

## Application standardization

This model of growth is driven by creating a generic application that isn't targeted at a specific process but a host of similar processes. The application could even provide a framework that enables the business to onboard themselves. This can achieve hyper-scale, in which you can broadly t-shirt size hundreds of processes or applications that serve more than one business process.

A general-purpose application allows scale, but can require more training and user readiness, so it must be thoughtfully done to be successful.

For example, consider a generic case management system that can accommodate hundreds of different case processes from different internal business functions that broadly involve similar steps. The business can create a team of resolvers, configure service-level agreements (SLAs), provide email notification templates, and create Microsoft Word or Excel templates to capture nonstandard data. But they can still use the generic application for core case management capabilities. All these actions have important considerations.

## Pivot

Pivots aren't necessarily expansion, but can trigger major change to an application, which could fundamentally change and further broaden its scope. For example, a targeted Power App used by a small team could go viral within an organization, and you must pivot to make it an organization-wide application.
