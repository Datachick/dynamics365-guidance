## Introduction

In a world where so much comes down to reporting and analytics, business intelligence has become the differentiator—it's all about actions and outcomes, measuring what matters the most, and empowering users with the right insights at the right time.

Business intelligence solutions have evolved to keep up with an ever-increasing number of data sources, as organizations seek ways to expand their global reach to attract more customers, and give their current customer base access to more content, purchasing channels, and brand options. In this context, turning collected data into competitive business knowledge is more important than ever.

While AI and machine learning keep evolving—and are now used natively by apps—your organization's intelligence strategy should be based on a modern data estate, with a focus on how to strengthen the organization.

## The importance of data

As mentioned in this [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Blog article](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/no-audience/2019/11/11/our-vision-for-the-microsoft-customer-data-platform/). "There is a fundamental change occurring across industries and organizations: Data now comes from everywhere and everything." As an essential part of a business solution, data represents a sizable portion of each user's engagement. The solution processes and analyzes the data to produce information, which allows an organization to make informed decisions, and determines actions that can come from it.

As a part of the day-to-day usage of any application, users generate significant amounts of process-related and customer-related data—structured and unstructured. For example, customers generate data by visiting a website or using a specific product. In turn, businesses generate data about their products or services, as well as how customers interact with those offerings.

In addition, the pace of data growth is increasing dramatically. Not only does user activity create data, but new data sources such as the Internet of Things (IoT) need to be captured, rationalized, and secured.

The key role of data is to generate information that helps businesses and customers make informed decisions. For businesses seeking to stay competitive, the data also must trigger actions demonstrating that they understand and value their customers.

Resilience—the ability to adapt quickly to changing conditions—has become a hallmark for business success today. Competitive, resilient organizations invest in turning the data they collect into business knowledge, build the right data estate to generate a 360-degree view of their users, and use business intelligence to determine the best actions and outcomes.

Organizations that have already embarked on their transformation journey to improve the ways they use data are better prepared to respond and adapt to change.

## Break the silos and use the digital feedback loop

Organizations are challenged by how to deal with ever-increasing amounts of data—and how to generate user value with it—especially when that data becomes siloed by the systems that generate or collect it. Data silos make the goal of having a 360-degree view of each user even more challenging. Successful organizations are able to digitally connect every facet of their business. Data from one system can be used to optimize the outcomes or processes within another. By establishing a digital feedback loop <!-- <T.G. Reference to figure not needed> (Figure 13-1)--> that puts data, AI, and intelligent systems and experiences at the core, organizations can transform, become resilient, and unlock new values for users.

## Evolution of business intelligence, reporting, and analytics

Practices for gathering, analyzing, and acting on data have evolved significantly over time. Traditional methods of standardizing and generating static reports no longer give businesses the agility to adapt to change. New technology and secure, highly reliable cloud services—which are poised to meet the needs of organizations that must quickly manage increasing amounts of data—have given rise to a new era of digital intelligence reporting.

### Traditional reporting

The early generations of business intelligence solutions were typically centralized in IT departments. Most organizations had multiple data repositories in different formats and locations that were later combined into a single repository using extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools, or they would generate reports within siloed sources and merge them to provide a holistic view of the business.

Once the data was unified, the next steps were deduplication and standardization, so the data could be structured and prepared for reporting. Business users who lacked the expertise to perform these tasks would have to rely on the IT team or specialized vendors. Eventually, the business would receive static intelligence reports, but the entire process could take days or even weeks, depending on the complexity of the data and maturity of the processes in place. Data would then undergo further manipulation, when required, and be shared across different channels, which could result in the creation of multiple versions that would be difficult to track.

Such an approach, which also heavily depended on the business owner's analysis to generate business insights and actions, was often a time-consuming and error-prone process. And if an error was found, it had to be fixed in the central repository. The process to produce the report would need to be executed again—and repeated multiple times if the same fix wasn't applied at the source. This method of reporting was referred to as "closing activities," because it typically occurred at the end of a month, quarter, or year, which meant that organizations were slow to respond to opportunities because they waited until the end of a given period to analyze their data and make decisions.

### Self-service reporting

The evolution to a more agile approach favored self-service capabilities to empower users. More user-friendly solutions reduced the IT dependency and focused on providing business users with access to data and visualization tools so they could do their own reporting and analytics. This accelerated the speed of data analysis and helped companies make data-driven decisions in competitive environments. However, in this model, reporting was unmanaged—increasing the number of versions of reports, as well as different representations of the data—which sometimes prevented organizations from using a standardized method to analyze data and inhibited effective decision-making.

This updated approach didn't entirely replace the IT-centric model, as many organizations started using a combination of traditional and self-service reporting, but it did provide quicker access to information, so organizations could react faster to business challenges and opportunities.

### Reporting from anywhere

The growth of IT infrastructures, networks, and business usage of devices such as mobile phones and tablets launched a digital transformation from legacy systems into more modern solutions for most organizations. Business intelligence apps allowed reporting from anywhere at any time, giving users access to data while they were out of the office or on business trips. These apps improved how organizations could respond to customers, and gave a 360-degree view of each customer interaction. They also provided more succinct visualizations of data, with better features to interpret it.

### The new era of business intelligence solutions

With data now coming from everywhere and everything, organizations must be prepared to convert that data into business knowledge so users can make informed decisions and trigger actions. Many organizations employ highly skilled workers, such as data scientists, who are responsible for analyzing the data and producing the necessary insights that can affect the business. This approach is expensive and adds dependency on specialized roles to perform tasks that usually can't be completed by typical business users.

An approach to reduce this dependency while simultaneously increasing ready access to data is to use augmented analytics, a feature of modern business intelligence solutions. According to [Gartner, Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/augmented-analytics), a research and advisory firm, "Augmented analytics is the use of enabling technologies such as machine learning and AI to assist with data preparation, insight generation, and insight explanation."

Embedded intelligence solutions that make use of augmented analytics allow processes, services, or products to deliver their own insights to increase quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. These are new types of reporting and analytic experiences where the intelligence is by-design, and the solution itself analyzes the data to provide insights. While the data may not yet be unified with such an approach, customers and organizations can use insights provided by products and services from the earliest phases of usage or production, which increases their return on investment (ROI).
