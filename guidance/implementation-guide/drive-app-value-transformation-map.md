# Transformation map

<!--So far, we have discussed a high-level approach to digital transformation and the various change streams that you need to consider. -->The ever-growing product backlog of feature asks, change requests, and product capabilities can overwhelm and potentially distract from the drivers for transformation. To determine time to value, you need a shared understanding across the business, IT, and users on how a product feature or change aligns with the goals of transformation and impacts the maturity of process implementation.

One way to visualize and communicate your digital transformation goals is to plot the application's capabilities in a transformation map.

You can adjust the definition of each quadrant to your own goals and ambitions for the process. Or just get started easily with the template we offer here. Plot all the feature asks, changes, and cloud product capabilities on this quadrant. Then, you can determine the current state of your business process implementation and agree on the future state aligned to your transformation goals.

For example, a sales system that only has the basic features of contact management and opportunity management may be considered essential. As a contrast, a system that can use AI-driven insights with advanced forecasting might be a differentiator that gives you competitive advantage in your industry.

Creating a dashboard for stakeholders that organizes the requirements and features in this fashion can bring great clarity, not just during initial implementation, but for future increments. It's also important to prepare for time-based decay, in which a feature that is considered a differentiator today might be considered essential in a few years. Similarly, something that is innovative or even considered ahead of its time could become a differentiator soon. You should plan to revisit and refresh this transformation map for each phase, product release, pivot, or strategic inflection in your business.
