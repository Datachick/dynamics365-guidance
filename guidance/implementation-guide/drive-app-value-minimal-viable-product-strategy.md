# Minimal viable product strategy

With a minimal viable product strategy (MVP), you can quickly build, measure, learn from feedback, and pivot, if necessary. The concept is well established in the startup world.

Bringing the invaluable [lean startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) mindset to digital transformation can help organizations deal with uncertainty from different change streams and find the value that drives maximum business impact in the least amount of time. Even in the context of digital transformation, MVP is often used to test the value of a solution to a business and gather feedback.

When you translate the lean startup methodology to a business application, don't use MVP to be a solution with just the basic and essential features. Create a solution to help transform your process and deliver on the most important transformation goals with the least amount of effort. Most importantly, an MVP isn't the end state; it should drive quick feedback, iterations, and pivot to program to avoid being in an MVP limbo for years.

## Example

Let's pick up the example of a sales application where users are currently using a homegrown sales system with a form to enter and view opportunity data. The system has a backend to store this information, which is also used for management reporting. The business has invested in a Dynamics 365 cloud-based sales application after assessing its rich features. The out-of-the-box AI insights, and integration capabilities with Power BI for reporting and analytics allows them to improve their opportunity closure rate and get accurate growth forecasts. A common approach is to first implement the out-of-the-box opportunity management process and reports, and plan future phases to implement AI-based insights with Power BI. Although you can easily follow this route, it doesn't achieve the actual goal of sales implementation. The system delivers an improved user experience but fundamentally does the same thing as the home-grown sales system, with little direct value to the business. Alternatively, using embedded intelligence with opportunity scoring and relationship health can help users target the right opportunities and improve their close rate, which directly affects business from day one.

## Characteristics

A good MVP has the following characteristics:

- It delivers on the most important of the digital transformation goals

- It's production-ready and uses supported customization techniques  

  This is different from a proof of concept or prototype designed to prove feasibility or get specific usability feedback  

- It goes beyond the essentials and delivers on top of the existing capability of the incumbent system

- It focuses effort on delivering maximum business value in the shortest amount of time. You might have to compromise on some experiences that aren't directly aligned to business outcomes.  

- It's built in a way that allows for quick changes based on feedback, making it possible to pivot  

  Think of a greater reliance on low-code configuration versus highly customized, professionally developed, code-heavy experiences

- You can test and learn the latest product features that could be activated  

  Requires some level of change management but almost no development effort  

- You can test the hypothesis of a specific feature or solution delivering the expected business outcome and adjust based on what you learn

- It creates the foundation for long-term success—it should support a building block mindset in which you keep adding without disrupting previous steps (for more information about the architectural skills to realize this approach, see the article ["Solution architecture design pillars"](solution-architecture-design-pillars.md).

Although the MVP approach naturally works with new green field implementations, you may have existing apps that are being replaced or migrated to another platform. Your scope should consider the existing functionality to ensure parity, but shouldn't try to mimic or replicate the experiences of the outgoing application. Focus your MVP strategy on delivering the most value to the business sooner without limiting the scope to essentials. An MVP with a broad scope that takes years to deliver may cease to be an MVP.
