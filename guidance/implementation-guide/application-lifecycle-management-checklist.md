# ALM Checklist

Use this article to help you develop and manage your strategy for application lifecycle management(ALM) for a Dynamics 365 implementation project.

## Establish the ALM at the onset

And align it to the environments, source control, implementation methodology, and automation strategy.

## Ensure the ALM provides an efficient, reliable, robust, and automated mechanism

To smoothly deploy the configurations and customizations across different environments, including peripheral solution components.

## Ensure ALM strategy enforces a source control-centric approach

That enables creation of new environments with the latest configurations without the need to replicate existing environments.

## Use a build automation and CI/CD pipeline for the project

## Consider the structure of the implementation team

To enable effective collaboration while providing exclusive control to developers where needed.

## Follow documented best practices in general and specifically to each app
