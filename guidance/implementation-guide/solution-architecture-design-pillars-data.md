# Solution architecture design: Data

The third pillar of solution design is *data*. A system with inaccurate, misleading, or partial data will lead to a failed implementation, so you must understand your data and how it fits into the overall solution. With the right data, you can identify actionable and analytical information that improves business intelligence. 

## Definitions

The following terms define your data:

- **Master data**  

  This term represents static information, such as details about customers and products, that you use and exchange in your business activities.

- **Transactional records**  

  This term refers to recorded business information, such as customer payments and expense reports, that you create, store, and report as part of your business process.

- **Documents**  

  This term refers to documentation, such as sales orders and customer invoices, that you create as part of your business process.

- **Reports**  

  Reports are organized or filtered information, such as a trial balance or aged debt, serving as input or output for your business activities.

At a minimum, you must start with an understanding of how your data is currently used and how it supports your future vision. Planning your data strategy upfront also allows for better scalability.  

## Key deliverables

The following list shows the key deliverables related to data.  

- Data governance strategy  
- Data architecture  
- Data migration and integration strategy  
- Data quality strategy  

The world is evolving from silos of data to connected enterprise data that enables the digital feedback loop. That's why a data strategy that applies artificial intelligence and analytics to make the data actionable is so critical to the overall success of your design.
