# Process-focused solution

<!-- Chapter 7-->Fast changing technologies and markets demand a rapid rhythm of delivering products and services. Business applications improve inefficient processes by automating, optimizing, and standardizing. The result: A more scalable business solution.

## Guidance

In this section, we cover the following type of guidance:

- Introduces the importance of a process-focused approach when implementing Dynamics 365 business applications  
- Explains why an approach based on business process mapping and management in an implementation project is fundamental if organizations are to achieve their goals  
- Emphasize the benefits of employing business processes as the primary framework for a project implementation cycle  
- Shows how implementations that use this approach gain more consistency in project phases, communication flows better, and processes run better  

## Start with business processes

Business processes are the main drivers to start defining the solution implemented in your project and make improvements along the way. Learn more at [Solution architecture design pillars](solution-architecture-design-pillars.md).  

## The business language

Every organization has an internal language they use to describe daily operations. The language is immersed in business processes, and it's often based on terminology common to the industry. During Dynamics 365 implementation projects, this business language is the best and most familiar way for the business to think about their needs, the tools and technologies that they use for work. This business language isn't simply terminology; it includes the processes used to conduct day-to-day transactions and activities. Curating and utilizing these processes in the language of the business is important to keep sight of the basic truths of business requirements. It also reduces the risk of the implementation team getting lost in the jargon and nomenclature of the technical tasks involved in the implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> This business common language often refers to this as taxonomy. Process taxonomy categories and classifies the content by organizing processes in hierarchy starting from the broad top to the detailed down ones.

When the project starts, putting the business process view of the organization at the core pays dividends.

When discussions about the project and business processes begin with third parties, this approach helps people who aren't familiar with the organization's business to begin learning this language.

## Start with a business process future vision

Creating a vision of how a business is transformed through technology makes it's easier to focus on the activities needed to achieve that goal. An understanding of how the business currently works helps establish the state that it wants to reach.

Successful implementations start with a clear understanding of an organization's business model. It often refers to as Target operation model (TOM). That includes understanding how the organization creates value through its products and services, as well as its relationships with customers and suppliers. There are multiple business processes strategically aligned to make that business model work. Learn more about how to define a business model and the importance of connecting the business model to business processes at [Drive app value](drive-app-value.md). Business processes provide the baseline to draw the roadmap of your solution for digital transformation.

The processes derived from the business model provide insight into what it takes to reach the desired future. Business processes define the functional scope of the solution being implemented. Any set of business processes being implemented needs definitions before you can start working on requirements and other aspects of the solution.

When defining your business model, assess the state of your processes. Some organizations may want to use new technology to optimize existing processes through automation. Others are moving to e-commerce or outsourcing parts of the operation, which requires new business processes. Still others might be moving to lean manufacturing.

A common mistake is that the new system that is implemented will define your processes. It's the other way round. Technology is an enabler. In many cases, it will change the user experience and drive a certain behavior. Nevertheless, the system should serve and fit your operations and it's the business stakeholders that define the business model.

Many organizations also seek to consolidate operations and introduce standard processes across different parts of the business. Understanding the state of the processes allows you to understand how to reach your goals. The effort required to implement an existing process using new technology is different than what is required to define new processes or gain consensus from stakeholders.

New business processes won't always be the same across a business. One division, for example, might decide to ship inventory directly to customers rather than to a warehouse, while others continue to use a warehouse. On the other hand, it may be that the model for employee purchasing is the same, so a shared product catalog and ordering process is implemented. In any case, business model analysis, process re-engineering, and standardization strategies should be considered part of the project definition. That firmly anchors the processes to the business strategy and also helps generate process-based project goals.
