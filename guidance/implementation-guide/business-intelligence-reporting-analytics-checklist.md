## Case study

Premier yacht brokerage cruises into smarter marketing and boosts sales by 70 percent with Dynamics 365 apps

To differentiate itself from the competition, a large company that supplies luxury vessels decided to invest in reporting and intelligence. In an industry where relationship-building efforts must be incredibly precise and personal, any insight into a customer's mindset is invaluable.

The company implemented a solution based on sales, marketing, and finance data, using Dynamics 365 apps and Power BI to help identify trigger points that would help increase sales to charter clients, strengthen customer relationships with improved marketing activities, and seamlessly move customers through the sales cycle.

This solution allowed the company to build intelligence on top of a centralized system running in the cloud, and facilitated a move from legacy systems where data was siloed in different applications, channels, and departments.

Dynamics 365 apps made it possible to separate the features each department would use while accessing the same data. The marketing and sales teams started customizing their content and campaigns to nurture leads toward a sale, and used Power BI reports to generate insights that helped them identify the best prospects and create winning proposals.

Integration with external applications brought in data from other sources to improve the company's bespoke offerings. For example, the sales teams could collate even more information about their products and send it to customers in just a few minutes—instead of spending hours manually putting together the data.

After deploying the Dynamics 365 solution, the company experienced a 70 percent increase in sales. They next brought in more departments to create a central hub for all activities, simplifying every area of their operation. For example, the sales team's process integrated everything that the accounting department needed to efficiently close a deal and reduce the possibility of human error.

The company is also using Dynamics 365 apps and Power BI to uncover market trends, as augmented analytics help the company learn about their customers in ways that were not possible before—and build authentic relationships that will last long after the initial sale. -->
