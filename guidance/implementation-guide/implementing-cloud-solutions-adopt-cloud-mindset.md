# Adopt a cloud mindset as part of the migration to Dynamics 365 online

Embracing change is a common theme, but infusing it throughout your organization is vital to your digital transformation journey. Therefore, we include it as a thread that runs throughout this article and this entire section. Adopting the cloud mindset can also help the organization break the mold. You'll start thinking differently about how applications are designed, developed, secured, and managed in the cloud.

First, let's understand the "why" behind the pervasive adoption of cloud business applications by organizations across the world. Traditional approaches to business applications mostly involve the IT department building a custom application or using an off-the-shelf product augmented with customizations to meet the specific business requirements. The typical approach includes phases to gather requirements, build, go live, operate, and then follow the change management process to request changes or add new features. The IT department has full control of the application, change process, releases, updates, infrastructure, and everything needed to keep the solution running for years.

On the surface, this sounds ideal. It has been the standard operating model for deploying and operating business applications. This way of working, however, is losing relevance in today's fast-paced world of shifting supply chains and evolving customer needs and expectations.

The development and deployment processes were disrupted, not necessarily because of the cloud or new technology—the undercurrent that made the cloud pervasive was the changing landscape of business. Unharnessed data from ubiquitous smart and IoT devices and other sources fueled startups that disrupted whole industries seemingly overnight. With that, the average lifespan of companies plummeted. This inflection made the survival of a business dependent on delivering the best product, the best customer experiences, and constant innovation to meet ever-growing expectations. This new business arena means businesses must change more often, evolve their processes more quickly, and become more data driven to understand customer needs, pain points, and preferences.

The changes we're talking about aren't the result of the cloud or technology. They're thrust upon us by the changing business landscape. Adopting a cloud mindset is about transforming your processes, people, culture, and leadership in such a way that your organization can embrace change quickly and successfully. We believe the fundamental organizational characteristics that determines success in this environment come from focusing on delivering business value through a secure cloud technology platform at a rapid pace. A platform with the ability to harness the data that is captured to generate insights and actions while supporting automation to quickly react to changing needs.

In this section, we explore these organizational characteristics that help drive the cloud-first mindset to achieve digital transformation.

> "Every company is a technology company, no matter what product or service it provides. Today, no company can make, deliver, or market its product efficiently without technology." — Forbes, ["Why Every Company is a Technology Company"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/01/23/why-every-company-is-a-technology-company/?sh=5fea730957ae)

## Focus on business value

Technology is a ubiquitous force that influences almost every business. Indeed, the IT department within a bank or a manufacturing company may be larger than entire tech companies. Understanding how technology affects customers and business is important to help any company survive and thrive. It's also important to not let technology hinder growth or impede business. The role of technology is to deliver business value by driving efficiency.

However, we often see enterprises whose technological landscape has become so large and complex over the years that they fail to deliver the agility demanded by the business. The IT departments are consumed with dealing with the complexity of software compatibility, update cycles, end of life deadlines, aging infrastructure, and antiquated security policies with little time to focus on delivering business value.

An evergreen cloud approach to your business application, however, takes away practical concerns. Much of the infrastructure and operational IT effort to keep the servers running, software patched, and other routine tasks go away, and the IT team can focus on the business. Operating in the cloud doesn't mean there are no operational responsibilities. Admins have to think about things like environment management, service updates, feature deprecations, user communications. They also have to coordinate change management for enhancements and new capabilities, monitoring, and support. These functions are all still required, but with a key difference: IT is now much closer to the business application layer and has a greater opportunity to focus their energy on delivering positive business outcomes.

Traditionally, business applications depict a set of key business processes that allows the users to capture, track, and report on the process and its progress. These business processes usually take the form of having a user interface (UI) built on top of an underlying data store to capture or display the information from the database. These "forms over data" software applications can help organizations keep track of information and make it easily available through reports. However, from an end user's perspective, they're a data capture tool that doesn't really help them do their job any faster or better. This design of business applications hasn't changed in decades. It's an outdated model that doesn't bring any more value to the business or to the end user, and doesn't differentiate a business's offerings and customer experience from their competition, which is likely following a similar outdated approach.

Additionally, on an individual level, we want to automate routine, boring tasks and focus on more creative, challenging work.

For example, take a point-of-sale application that helps you address your customer by their first name. It will provide them with personalized relevant offers based on their loyalty, or recommend products based on their purchase history and artificial intelligence (AI). Your employees and your customers will apreciate this experience better than an application that can barely determine if a product is in stock or not. Simply offering the best deal or best quality product isn't enough in today's hyper-competitive environment. To win, you need to differentiate between your customers, respond to their unique behaviors, and react to fluctuating market demands.

Businesses likely already have the data to do this job, but may lack the technology to turn data into practical insight. For example, Dynamics 365 Commerce taps your systems to gather customer intelligence from a myriad of sources (such as social media activity, online browsing habits, and in-store purchases) and presents it so that you can shape your service accordingly. You can then manage product recommendations, unique promotions, and tailored communications, and distribute them across all channels via the platform.

Dynamics 365 applications are focused on delivering value to the business and empowering end users, changing the business application industry paradigm by forcing every business to innovate faster.

The "If it isn't broke, don't fix it" mentality common in large organizations, where business applications can remain unchanged for several years, puts the enterprise at risk. Maybe your business is a monopoly and can sustain itself without investing in technology. But the hard reality is many businesses don't survive without strategic plans for digital transformation.

You need to ask yourself some questions:

- Has the rest of your industry transformed and embraced technology?

- Do your customers demand a better and faster process?

- Is your competition growing their market share by eating into yours?

- Does your competition have a better Net Promoter Score (NPS)?

If you answered yes to most or if you don't know the answers, your business might be failing to adapt and react to changes in customer behavior and expectations. Businesses that don't invest in technology face challenging disruptive competitors, either global behemoths or innovative startups. You need digital transformation technology that gives you the command of three essentials: deep, cross-channel customer insight, synchronized operations from front end to back end, and agility to drive rich experiences as needed.

Decision-making around such technology now carries existential consequences. Lack of strategic visionary thinking, long-term planning, and matching investments can prove to be catastrophic.

The critical point is your business application shouldn't be designed and deployed with an expectation that it remains unchanged for long periods of time. Instead, the core design principle for business applications should be ease of change. You should take advantage of the wonders of automation to deliver changes as often as daily and weekly, at the whim of business. This continuous development philosophy is core to Dynamics 365 online with weekly maintenance updates and multiple waves of new features delivered every year. To realize the value of these cloud applications, adopt the latest best-in-class capabilities, continuously delivered. With this new mindset, Dynamics 365 online isn't just used to meet business requirements. the Dynamics 365 apps help drive business value and adoption.

Technology is becoming so powerful and democratized that nondevelopers and people with no formal training in software development can build applications. They can create workflows that automate their work, and use machine learning with ready-made AI models to analyze data. This concept of citizen application development has drastically transformed businesses, where end users are developing solutions to solve business problems and sharing these applications with colleagues. This organic approach to app development has short-circuited the application development lifecycle, helping address the perennial issue of software adoption. IT departments are now responsible for the governance of these applications. They're charged with securing the access to data and environment, and focusing on building the underlying services and connector interfaces that the business can consume in their applications.

These scenarios all help illustrate how a transition to the cloud can play an instrumental role in refocusing technology to deliver business value.

## Driven by data

Data fuels the disruptive innovation we're seeing across several industries. Almost everything around us generates data:  

- Appliances
- Machines in factories  
- Cars  
- Apps  
- Websites  
- Social media  

What differentiates one company from another is the ability to harness this data and successfully interpret the information to generate meaningful signals that can be used to improve products, processes, and customer experiences.

:::image type="content" source="media/implementing-cloud-solutions-fueld-by-data.png" alt-text="Driven by data" :::

Organizations recognize data is an asset, and becoming data driven is a key motivator for digital transformation. Still, the accounting rigor that we see in finance is seldom observed when it comes to managing organizational data. If data is the new currency, then we should treat it like that. Get an understanding of your organizational data estate, including the databases, data warehouses, and data lakes. The knowledge helps your company manage its corporate data. Develop a holistic view of customer data across departments, functions, and applications, while acknowledging the regulatory boundaries on data usage. These steps are practically a prerequisite to digital transformation.

Depending on the volume of data, its age, and organizational silos, the deduplication, correlation, and conflation of data from different systems could become a complex project on its own.

Modern AI-powered customer data platform (CDP) technologies can help, including Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. A CDP tool creates a persistent, unified customer database that is accessible to other systems. Data is pulled from multiple sources, cleaned, and combined to create a single customer profile.

It's also important to define your organizational data strategy for business applications. Develop guidelines on how new applications store their data, what schema they use, and how other applications in the organization can understand and use this data. You must use the most optimal datastore for your use case. For example, keeping historical transactions in Dataverse is suboptimal; a data lake might be a better choice.

Being data driven is about better understanding your data's quality and relevance, and being able to generate valuable insights that are actionable and can provide feedback loop to improve your business processes. Going back to the point of embracing change, your data strategy should reflect how you design your process, develop your applications, and operate. If it takes several months to deploy a change request or years to roll out an improved process, there's little point.

A data-driven business application cloud platform like Dynamics 365 enables you to:

- Create a data estate that is intelligent and AI-ready

- Connect and consume data from legacy on-premises systems, other line of business applications, and third-party applications

- Have the necessary controls to secure and meet data compliance requirements

- Build smart applications that are continuously improving

- Infuse data intelligence directly into the application, empowering users to make effective and smart decisions

- Have agility so applications can quickly adapt to changes in your process

Overall, the intelligence and insights you generate from your data are proportional to the quality and structure of your data. You can explore this subject more in the articles [Data management](data-management.md) and [Business intelligence, reporting, and analytics](business-intelligence-reporting-analytics-overview.md).

## Think platform

An organization can take several approaches towards digital transformation. In many cases, you start with a single application being deployed to a SaaS cloud. A key responsibility of IT decision-makers and enterprise architects is to deliver a cloud platform for their organization's digital transformation. Individual applications and their app feature sets are important. But you should also look at the larger picture of what the cloud platform offers and what its future roadmap looks like. It'll help you understand if the platform can meet the short-term and long-term objectives of your digital transformation.

Thinking about the platform versus a single app offers clear benefits. You avoid reinventing the wheel with each extra application, and you instead deliver a foundation approved by governing bodies, with clear patterns and practices. This approach limits risk and brings a built-in structure that enables reuse. Platform thinking doesn't necessarily mean that other cloud platforms or legacy applications have to be rebuilt and replaced. Instead, you can incorporate them as part of an all-encompassing platform for your organization, with well-defined processes and patterns that enable integration and flow of data between applications. Bringing this "systems thinking" to deliver a platform for business applications can drastically reduce the amount of time lost getting security and design approvals for individual apps, thereby improving your agility and time to value.

Your business applications platform should already provide the following aspects:

- Necessary security and design approvals for processing data in specific categories based on its sensitivity and regulatory requirements

- Clear guidelines on extending and customizing the platform to ensure supportability and agility

- Established governance process to manage access and service operation

- Approved integration patterns for communication with other platforms and on-premises systems, with a clear process for approving deviations

- Data storage guidelines for apps and patterns for sharing

- Clear guidelines for data ownership and access

- License entitlements that are available for individual apps

- Documented service protection limits and best practices that your applications should comply with

- Resources for more learning and guidance with access to experts

The due diligence and foundational work you do with IT and business decision-makers to choose the right cloud platform can save weeks, if not months, of effort downstream. This thorough evaluation also helps drive predictable success.

## Embrace DevOps and automation

Traditionally, the process to manually release a change to applications was convoluted, involving several teams, change boards, manual regression tests, and approvals. It took weeks. This complexity makes teams averse to change. Enhancements and updates are then consistently deferred, which affects the adaptability of your applications to shifting business and technology priorities. Automating builds and releases and building in testing automation is crucial to allow for continuous software updates.

The biggest selling point of the cloud is to stay current and quickly deploy software. Relying on manual testing to validate cloud software updates can place a significant drain on your team's resources and may lead to inconsistencies if testing is neglected.

Traditionally, a time lag existed between code and test and deploy. A bug in production meant repeating the lengthy cycle. The fear of breaking code meant that teams tended to delay updates for as long as possible. With automation, you deploy fast and potentially fail fast. This is where the culture of fail fast comes in. Automated processes help companies empower their teams to take risks. You fail but quickly release a fix. Over time failures decrease and success rates improve, instilling confidence in teams to deploy and innovate and delivering value to the business faster. At the core of the cloud mindset is understanding and embracing DevOps. [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/) helps combine people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers. DevOps is a cultural change in which we break down silos between developers and administrators, and create shared responsibility for the quality of released software. The DevOps process automates software delivery and speeds up the technology deployment lifecycle (Figure 3-2).

:::image type="content" source="media/implementing-cloud-solutions-devops-process.png" alt-text="Devops process" :::

The idea is to have development, IT, quality, and security teams collaborate to produce more reliable and quality products. Together, they can innovate and respond more quickly to the changing needs of business. Implementing DevOps inherently depends on automation: automating the build process to enable continuous deployment, regression tests to improve speed and reliability, and administrative actions like user and license management.

At this point, we should also explore continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) in the context of the cloud. The idea is each code check-in from the developer should go into the main build and get tested early. This approach takes CI to the next level by allowing for automated testing and continuous, automated code deployment.

If a change includes a bug, the build fails, and the cycle repeats. The automation allows for changes to happen quickly without unnecessary overhead—a team can focus on the business logic and not the infrastructure. Therefore, with CD we always have the most up-to-date working software.

CI and CD bring agility to cloud solutions by allowing for the latest changes and bug fixes to move to production code without delay.

But this isn't just a technological change. DevOps requires close collaboration between development, testing, and deployment teams. This is a cultural and mindset change in which the whole team trusts each other, feels empowered, and is collectively responsible for product quality. Preparing your organization for the fast-paced world of the cloud means that automation isn't optional anymore.
