# Solution architecture design: Vision and strategies

Solution design starts with a vision and the business strategies and solution strategies to deliver on that vision.

## Vision

A vision is the desire to achieve something, to change the present and improve the future.

When an organization decides to go through a transformation, it's usually because one or more people predicted what was coming and expressed a desire for change. Or maybe a change was forced by industry disruption or regulations. Such a change could be in the form of a mission statement or a business case listing its objectives, which might include:

- Modernizing legacy enterprise business applications.

- Finding unified and faster ways of working.

- Earning higher profits.

- Achieving better service or product quality.

- Improving the user experience.

- Empowering users to drive greater value by building apps.

As the vision comes together, the plan for achieving it can start taking shape.

## Business strategy

Every vision serves a purpose, as does every organization, and any solution needs to be aligned with this purpose. A business strategy supports your vision by answering fundamental questions, such as:

- **Why** are you making this change, and what are the anticipated benefits? What is the business value sought by the solution? Where do you imagine the organization will be in 5, 10, or 20 years?

- **What** business capabilities can your organization offer with the new solution? What **business processes** can you run? What **information and data** would you like to record and report on in line with your organization's services or products?

- **Which** clients, customers, or **people** inside the organization will be served by the new solution, and who will be affected by it?

- **Would** you like to improve your current line of business or are you open to a new industry?

- **When** do you plan to have the vision materialized? What is the high-level timeline? And do you intend to deliver the solution at once or grow in stages?

- **Where** are the regions, geographically and in terms of business functions, to which the solution will apply? Will you apply it to all or just some of them?

- **Who** is going to plan, design, and deliver the solution? Do you have a preferred partner, or do you need to select a vendor? Who will support and maintain the solution post go-live?

- **How** will you incorporate **technology** into your solution?  This question is the first step of solution design and the link to your **solution strategy**, and the business case for IT transformation.  

## Solution strategy

Your solution strategy is a consolidated view and approach that defines your overall solution. A solution blueprint is a living document with several review points <!--(Figure 1-x)--> during a project's lifespan to help you identify and take necessary actions, mitigate risks, and resolve issues as they arise. In the Success by Design framework, the blueprint is considered essential for a project's success, and provides a view of the overall solution architecture and dependent technologies.

The Solution Blueprint Review workshop is a mandatory part of the solution design experience, and helps you keep track of your solution design's progress to ensure that your vision and objectives are still viable. It also allows solution architects and the implementation team to review and gain an understanding of your:

- Program strategy

- Test strategy

- Business process strategy

- Application strategy

- Data strategy

- Integration strategy

- Intelligence strategy

- Security strategy

- Application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy

- Environment and capacity strategy

Capturing these details helps you understand the project, and validates your solution design via the complete and well-organized processes, data, and people enabled by Dynamics 365.
