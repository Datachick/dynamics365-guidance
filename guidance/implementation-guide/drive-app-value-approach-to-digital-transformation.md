# An approach to digital transformation

As part of the Dynamics 365 guidance content, many articles discuss several concepts related to [Success by Design](success-by-design.md), including how to initiate, implement, and deploy a project. But the scope of Success by Design isn't limited to a successful go live or operational excellence. The long-term goal of Success by Design is to create the right foundation for an organization to evolve their business application landscape and expand their digital transformation footprint.

An implementation with Dynamics 365 doesn't necessarily qualify as a digital transformation program aligned to the business. Several systems migrate to the cloud unchanged as a part of infrastructure modernization, or to ensure supportability. In some cases, it's just the first step towards enabling digital transformation. Opportunities could arise to take it further and deliver transformational value to the business rather than looking at it as just an upgrade that's run by the IT team with little involvement from the business.

The discussion in this article targets business-focused digital transformation programs and their expansion. Before we go into the details of expanding a solution to further drive value, let's discuss the fundamental approach to transformation and investigate the following aspects of it:

- Represent your current business model  
- Capture the factors that affect your business model  
- Review how they can trigger transformation  
- Define your goals and scope of business processes for a transformation roadmap  

## Represent the business model

Before you define a digital transformation roadmap, a good strategic exercise is to holistically develop an understanding of your business model. Define the business at an organizational, departmental, business unit, or team level to understand the value that you currently deliver. Learn who your customer is, and how to deliver that value and the key activities and resources involved.

You could use several different techniques or frameworks to describe an organization's business model and how they create value. One framework that we discuss in more detail is the [Business Model Canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas), developed by Alexander Osterwalder. It offers a simple, holistic, and easy-to-understand representation of a business model. This model is in the public domain. Microsoft doesn't endorse it or include it in Success by Design. However, you can use the model to not only map your existing business model but also highlight what aspects of your business model are changing, which your digital transformation strategy helps you adapt to.

The business model represents the "why" and what it takes to deliver the value to customer; how we go about doing it's the business process definition.

## Triggers

Disruptions and inflections in the business model create opportunities for transformation. In a world that's changing at a pace greater than ever, businesses have to reinvent themselves more often, improve customer experiences, and attract and retain talent. The opportunities for impact are plentiful<!-- TODO ADD LINK TO CHAPTER 1 (for a deeper discussion, see the article  ["Introduction to Implementation Guides"](placeholder.md)) -->.

Let's explore some examples of how changes can be a catalyst that triggers changes to business processes and applications.

- **Changes in customer segment**  

  As businesses evolve their products and expand their target customer base and demographics, they learn that their approach to their potential customer base must also evolve. It's critical to have targeted messaging that resonates and is delivered through relevant channels. Does your marketing automation and customer data platform enable this development?

- **New channels**  

  Customer channels that the business uses to deliver their product and services are evolving. For example, customers expect remote delivery of services via digital channels instead of an in-person visit to a store. In many places, this expectation grew during the COVID-19 pandemic. What does this change in channels mean for your order management systems or other related business processes?

- **Changes in value proposition**  

  Businesses might differentiate themselves by coming up with unique customer value propositions in highly competitive sectors, such as offering a lucrative subscription model, to drive recurring revenue and shareholder value. For example, customers aged 25–40 are more open to subscription-based purchases versus outright ownership. The automobile industry now offers cars on a subscription basis and charges based on miles driven, as opposed to customers paying full purchase price. How are your processes and business applications affected by this change in business model?

- **Changes in customer relationships**  

  An organization's approach to engaging with customers evolves with the business. For example, an organization could change from an aggressive customer acquisition phase to retaining and upselling within their existing customer base after acquiring a fair market share. How is your customer engagement strategy changing, what does it mean for your system?

- **Changes in revenue streams**  

  As businesses evolve, they create new revenue streams. For example, an energy provider in a highly competitive market might provide home services to expand their revenue stream, which triggers changes to customer processes and related business applications. Do you know how your revenue stream changes affect your business applications?

- **Resources and sustainability**  

  More organizations are committing to environmental sustainability. How do your manufacturing and operations track your carbon footprint, impact on emissions, and procurement from sustainable sources?

- **Custom manufacturing**  

  With the advances in 3D printing technology, a manufacturing company can offer custom, made-to-order options to their customers. How does it affect your operations processes and enterprise resource planning (ERP) application?

- **Partnerships and acquisitions**  

  Inorganic, acquisition-based growth is common in several industries, and so is the strategic partnership between organizations to grow market share where they have complementary services. How do these changes affect process alignment and your supporting business applications?

- **Cost and efficiency**  

  New technologies offer efficiency advantages that can reduce operational costs. For example, delivery companies use electronic signatures instead of paper-based solutions to get real-time notifications and provide new value to customers. Are there opportunities to drive process efficiency using the latest technology?

- **External factors**  

  Changes in the socioeconomic situation, political climate, and regulations can affect the way organizations conduct business. For example, the EU's decision to bring in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) affected every business with employees and customers in EU, which required changes to their business applications to ensure compliance. How are new and changing regulations impacting your business?

These triggers can all disrupt your existing business model. You can use the Business Model Canvas to highlight what aspects of your business model are changing and align your digital transformation strategy to these changes. At the end, your business adapts and grows.

## Digital transformation goals

Changes to the business model can kickstart a digital transformation, based on various triggers. These transformation goals must be defined in business terms, with measurable metrics that could potentially involve several milestones. Let's look at an example in which an organization's goal is to create a 360-degree view of their customer. They want a holistic view of their customer, their activity history, product purchases, subscriptions, and more. But this goal doesn't relate to a business outcome or a measurable key performance indicator (KPI). A measurable goal for your digital transformation could be the business's ability to increase upsell to existing customers by X percent, or to reduce the time to address customer queries by Y percent. You need a 360-degree view of the customer.

Although most programs begin with a set of business goals, it's equally important to communicate and reiterate these goals to the IT and technical teams implementing solutions. In long-running transformation programs involving several technologies, teams and partners might lose sight of the actual business goals by letting technology become a distraction.

## Business process

The next stage of the process is discovery, which involves key business stakeholders. With a holistic view of the evolving business model and transformation goals in place, you can identify the related business processes and applications that need to change. The discovery exercise should be focused on creating clarity around how the business processes and applications identified need to evolve to meet the corresponding transformation goals.

The scope of change could be automating a manual activity to improve productivity, capture data accurately to improve the effectiveness of strategy, drive user efficiency, or enable the business to generate insights about your customers by eliminating data siloes.

Prioritize the changes to maximize and deliver measurable business impacts continuously without having to wait for a multi-year transformation program to complete. Prioritize to keep the digital transformation in the foreground, with engagement from the business, end users, and executive sponsors maintaining its relevance. Business agility should be the key focus for long-running, comprehensive transformation, or you risk missed business opportunities and loss of market share.
