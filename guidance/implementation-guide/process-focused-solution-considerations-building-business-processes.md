# Considerations for building business processes

In a nutshell, there are some recommendations to build your processes, creating a process-focused solution view of your implementation that will bring more quality, optimization, and standardization in your business.

- Elaborate a Business Process Catalog  

  The Business Process Catalog can work as a baseline from where other more detailed business processes will be derived.

- Define clearly business requirements and goals  

  Your requirements will be mapped to processes, and processes will be mapped towards achieving the business goals.

- Map the *As-is* process and the *To-be* process (if applicable)  

  It's important to have clarity on what the process is as of today and what the next level for that process should be to achieve business goals. In case there's a green field implementation project, you'll focus on drawing the to-be process only.

- Define the different levels and types of business processes  

  Depending on the type of process, the hierarchy level, and the message you want to convey, you can choose how to represent each as there are different forms of flows to help you illustrate your business processes, including the following flows:

  - Basic Process flow

  - Cross-functional flow

  - Data flow

  - Decision flow

  - Workflow process

  - Business value process flow

  - Value stream map

- Build the End-to-End processes  

  The end-to-end process is the holistic representation of the core processes, breaking up the silos and showing the overall purpose of the business. Identify the business areas of your organization and create the end-to-end business process for each. For example:

  - HR: Recruit to Retire

  - Sales: Order to Cash

  - Procurement: Procure to Pay

  - Customer: Quote to Cash

  - Marketing: Market to Order

- Define roles and responsibilities  

  Help ensure proper access and security of the users that will be executing business process tasks and activities. It will also help to measure the number of users, and the number of licenses needed to consider in project budget.

- Determine what fits to standard and what the system gaps are  

  Most of the time, the current processes may not be covered in full in the new system, which isn't necessarily unfavorable. On the contrary, it could be that there are better or more optimal ways to execute them. More developments may be required to cover the business needs.

- Reassess your business processes  

  You can plan to monitor and reassess your business processes during multiple iterations, for example, in every CRP (Conference Room Pilot), to verify that information is still accurate and make any needed adjustments.
