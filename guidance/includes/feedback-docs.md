On the *learn.microsoft.com* website, each documentation article encourages you to provide feedback. We've changed the mechanism a couple of times based on, well, feedback. Currently, we ask you to choose the **Feedback** action below the article's title. Give the article a rating, and write a comment if you want to. The feedback goes straight to the article's author and the team that owns the docs.
