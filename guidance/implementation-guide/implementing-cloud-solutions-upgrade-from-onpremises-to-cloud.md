# Upgrade from on-premises to Dynamics 365 online

Many organizations have invested in on-premises deployment of business applications. These solutions might serve the users and the business well in their current state, but keeping them on-premises might limit your opportunity for expansion. In these cases, you should explore upgrading or migrating an existing on-premises business application to the cloud. You can bring along existing business processes and data to speed up your digital transformation.

Dynamics 365 provides the tooling and support to help on-premises deployment upgrades or migrations to the cloud, subject to compatibility and security checks. This option to upgrade to the cloud also helps organizations take advantage of their existing investments in implementation, as long as the supported implementation techniques are used and compatible with the cloud. Still, everything we discuss in this section is fully applicable, including considerations, extension, and operations.

## Considerations

When upgrading or migrating to the cloud, consider the following items:

- Assess if the legacy system meets the requirement of the business and whether the business users like it. It's the most critical factor in deciding on the upgrade-to-cloud approach.  

- The data model, design, and data quality should ensure that the application being upgraded becomes a stepping stone to accelerate digital transformation. The upgraded application should serve as a foundation for further growth and adoption of new capabilities in the cloud. It shouldn't stifle cloud adoption by carrying over poor design and data.

- Choose a cloud platform that's approved to store and process data in accordance with the organization's security policies and regulations. The patterns used for authentication and integration also need to be revisited to make sure they're cloud ready.

- Understand the data category, flow, transformations, location, and encryption during and post migration. The knowledge helps you navigate organizational security policies and plan your cutover.  

- The upgrade to the cloud can be a multi-staged process that involves stringent compatibility and validation checks. It's critical to understand the process and review the prerequisites early in the process.  

- Some components in the on-premises application may need to be remediated or replaced to ensure cloud readiness. Examples to look at include deprecation, unsupported customizations, and non–cloud ready patterns that pose a security or performance risk.

- Existing integration and peripheral applications require changes to ensure they work with the cloud applications.

- Any impact on process, performance, and usability due to latency, service protection limits, or license capacity should be considered.

The ability to bring existing Dynamics 365 on-premises applications into the cloud with proper due diligence can be a game-changer for your digital transformation.

> [!TIP]
> The [Dynamics 365 Migration Program](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/migration-program/) can help you take the first step toward cloud success by migrating your on-premises solution with expert guidance from Microsoft. Learn more at the [overview of our program](/dynamics365/get-started/migration/migration-overview), or perform a [standard migration assessment](/dynamics365/get-started/migration/standard-migration-assessment). You can also [move from Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 in the cloud](/dynamics365/get-started/migration/moving-to-the-cloud).
