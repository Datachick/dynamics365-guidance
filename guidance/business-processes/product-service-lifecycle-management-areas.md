# Product and service lifecycle management business process areas

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Microsoft Supply Chain Center***

The product and service lifecycle management process is broken down into business process areas for categorizing products and services, introducing new products and services, maintaining product data, organizing and assigning product attributes and catalogs, designing and configuring manufactured products, controlling product engineering changes, defining product and service costing, managing product and service pricing, managing product assortments and catalogs, and managing product lifecycle, respectively. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

## Categorize products and services

This business process area involves categorizing products and services based on various attributes such as product type, product line, service type, brand, and so on. The exact categories in your organization will vary based on the complexity of the products and services you offer and the industry and types of products and services you offer. Categorization helps in organizing products and services and making it easier for customers to find what they are looking for. Internally, categorization helps you report and analyze trends on your products and services. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Commerce support the creation of category hierarchies to further enhance the discoverability of your products and services.

## Introduce new products and services

Every organization has a process to develop and introduce new products and services to the market. The process includes idea generation, concept development, product design, testing, and launch. Office 365 includes a variety of tools to help you keep organized, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes tools to help with the business process flow of introducing new products including a configurable workflow. For more basic products, you can also design a business process flow in Dynamics 365 Sales. When you are ready to test new products and advertise new products, Dynamics 365 Marketing includes a variety of tools to help you with the process. A well-managed introduction of new products and services can help organizations stay competitive and meet customer needs. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKIntroduce new products and services\]. -->

## Maintain product data

Once an organization launches a product or service, maintaining accurate and up-to-date product data such as product specifications, pricing, availability, and other relevant information is critical to the ongoing use and maintenance of the system. Accurate product data is essential for providing customers with the right information and ensuring that the products are marketed effectively. For products that you purchase or manufacture, it is critical to the costing and production process to ensure the information is accurate and up to date. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKMaintain product data\]. -->

## Organize and assign product attributes and catalogs

This business process area involves organizing and assigning product attributes such as color, size, style, and configuration, to products. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management also supports unlimited custom-defined attributes that can be used to report, analyze, and display in the point of sale or website when you use it together with Dynamics 365 Commerce. Additionally, you can create catalogs to group related products together. Organizing products in this way can help customers find products more easily and make it easier for organizations to manage and analyze their product data. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKOrganize and assign product attributes and catalogs\]. -->

## Design and configure manufactured products

Organizations that design or manufacture products have additional processes that are supported by Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to assist with the design and configuration of manufactured products, including creating product designs, bills of materials (BOMs) or formulas, and routing information (manufacturing steps). We also support simpler scenarios where kits or bundles are assembled either in a store or warehouse, for example. Efficient product design and configuration can help organizations reduce costs and improve product quality. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKDesign and configure manufactured products\]. -->

## Control product engineering changes

This business process area involves controlling changes made to product designs and configurations, ensuring that changes are properly documented, approved, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes a robust Engineering change management module to help organizations manage product changes. Effective change control can help organizations minimize the risk of product defects and improve product quality. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKControl product engineering changes\]. -->

## Define product and service costing

All organizations need to analyze and define the costs associated with manufacturing and delivering products and services, including direct material costs, direct labor costs, and overhead costs. Dynamics 365 Sales includes the ability to assign basic costs to products, while Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes more robust costing capabilities including, but not limited to multiple costing methodologies such as LIFO, FIFO, standard, and average costing, cost calculations and roll-ups for manufactured or purchased products, including indirect cost calculations for overheads. Understanding product and service costs is essential for setting prices and making informed business decisions.

## Manage product and service pricing

Once you have defined costs, you can start to manage and define product and service prices based on various factors such as cost, competition, and customer demand. Effective pricing strategies can help organizations improve profitability and maintain a competitive advantage. Dynamics 365 Sales includes basic sales pricing functionality, while Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management has a pricing engine that includes trade agreements, price lists, customer loyalty programs, promotions, and discounts to help determine the best price. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKManage product and service pricing\]. -->

## Manage product assortments and catalogs

Defining and managing product assortments and catalogs, involves the determination of which products to offer, creating and maintaining catalogs, and managing inventory levels. Effective management of product assortments and catalogs can help organizations optimize sales and minimize costs. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKManage product assortments and catalog\]. -->

## Manage product lifecycle

This business process area involves managing the entire lifecycle of a product or service, from ideation to retirement. Managing the product lifecycle involves making strategic decisions about product development, pricing, and marketing to ensure that the product remains profitable and relevant to the market. <!--Learn more at TODO ADD LINKManage product lifecycle\]. -->
