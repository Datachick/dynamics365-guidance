This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to *Plan and recruit your workforce* as part of the *hire to retire* business process. Planning and recruiting is a foundational business process area that is upstream of most business processes across a business. It's important to define department structures and define and manage jobs and positions so that you may assign workers to tasks. Similarly, it's required to create and manage shifts and define work calendars and schedules before you can record time and attendance and pay employees. Planning and recruiting your workforce should be done early in the implementation because the associated configurations are required to support day-to-day operations and business processes.  

Input from various stakeholders is required to complete these steps. The list includes but isn't limited to the following roles:

- **Finance** is required to define the relevant financial dimensions  
- **HR** and **Administrative stakeholders** must define organizational details  
- **IT Operations** may be needed to import data  

## *Plan and recruit your workforce* process flow
