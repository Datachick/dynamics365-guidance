# Service the solution

Your solution has been deployed to production. Users have been trained and onboarded. A support process is in place. Most implementation projects focus on building and deploying the solution. Often there's less emphasis on learning how to keep the new system optimal and healthy.

But you might be thinking, *Dynamics 365 is a cloud platform. Isn't Microsoft responsible for maintaining these environments?*

Let's take a scenario where you rent an apartment in a large building complex. The owner of the building is responsible for cleanliness and upkeep of the building and common areas. They provide plumbing and electricity for each apartment. Maybe they add or improve amenities such as an exercise gym or a garden in the yard. But it's each renter's responsibility to keep their apartment in good condition. The renter should clean the apartment and throw out their garbage. They'll need to replace the light bulbs in their lamp if it goes out. If there are any issues with the plumbing, they must contact the building manager so that a repair person can be dispatched to help. In a similar way, Microsoft as the owner of the software platform is responsible for the platform, the building and property in our scenario. Our customer is responsible for the upkeep of the health of their solution, the apartment.

## Summary

There are several key areas of focus to ensure that your system continues to operate smoothly and provides helpful new features to the user community.

## Monitor service health

It all starts with visibility into the health of the system through proper monitoring. Having the right telemetry and managing notifications from the system as well as Microsoft will help you to prioritize and act to address maintenance needs.

## Service updates

A large part of the overall maintenance is simply understanding the continuous update model of the Dynamics 365 service. We recommend that you're' proactive in planning, communicating, and deploying service updates to gain the benefits of new features and enhancements made available throughout the year.

## Environment maintenance

Appropriate maintenance of your environments and data will help protect and optimize your solution. It's a team effort, not just the responsibility of IT administrators. By working across the business and technology resources, you can make sure that the solution performs well and maximizes results for the user community.

## Continue the business application journey

Just as your solution is continuously updated, organizations also need continuous education in trends and tools related to your business applications. With awareness of the product roadmap and improvements in ancillary products, you can maximize your organization's investment in the Dynamics 365 platform.

## Case study

An agricultural business implemented finance and operations apps including some extensions that involved an ISV. They discovered the ISV provided updates later in the release cycle or sometimes not at all due to their own internal processes. As a result, the organization found themselves unable to implement new features as they became available and had to manually apply Dynamics 365 updates to maintain operations properly. They were eventually able to work with their ISV to align their release schedule to Microsoft’s timeline, giving them enough time to test their solution during standard releases. Simply implementing and updating the solution wasn’t enough. Organizations must be aware of third-party solutions that may have impact on the Dynamics 365 release cadence. Keep track of how soon the updates can be applied in your environment to maximize the benefits from the latest Microsoft innovations as they become available.  

## Conclusion

Take steps to be aware of your solution performance, be proactive in taking action, and be prepared with a solid strategy for maintaining your environments. Keep up on new trends and tools that can help improve your solution and your organization.
