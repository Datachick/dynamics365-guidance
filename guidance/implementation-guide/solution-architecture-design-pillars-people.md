# Solution architecture design pillars: People

It's not every process or activity that involves a person. But there's always a step or output that involves people, whether internal (employees and contractors) or external (customers and vendors). So the solution design includes the people pillar. People shape the solution design in many ways, including these examples:

- Geographical location

- Time zones

- Languages

- Customs

- Usability

- Internal and external hierarchies

- Organizational structure

This pillar of solution design is represented by the **organizational architecture (structure)**, which visually intersects with process architecture in **process maps**, and includes:

- Geographical structure

- Organizational groupings

- Line of business

- Reporting lines and reporting rollup

- Security access

- Segregation of duties

The following illustration shows an example of a *cross-functional process flow* mapped to the business users/personas.

Once the organizational structure and process flows and maps are designed, the **list of business roles** (personas) becomes evident and can be finalized. The next step is to **map the business users to the system security roles** that will determine the security design. Learn more at [Security](security.md).

## Dependent activities in the People pillar

In addition to the key deliverables, the People pillar is followed by and works together with several other activities:

- Change management, communication plan and management, learn more at [Implementation Strategy](implementation-strategy.md)

- Training plan and management, learn more at [Training Strategy](training-strategy.md)

- Testing, learn more at [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)
