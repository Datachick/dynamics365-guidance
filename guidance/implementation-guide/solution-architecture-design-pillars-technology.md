# Solution architecture design pillar: Technology

While technology doesn't drive all the processes, it provides the backbone of products and services required to fulfill your businesses strategy. Your processes dictate which technology to use and when, and that technology will bring your digital transformation to life. For example, the Dynamics 365 Sales app provides value-added details about your organization's lead-to-opportunity pipeline. Other examples of technology that's under the hood to support users include:

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

- Software as a service (SaaS)

- Integration tools

- Business intelligence tools

- Azure AI

- Azure Machine Learning

- Data connectors

- Customer portals

- Mobility solutions

The technology and system selection are performed during the sales process as part of the first high-level fit gap assessment. Learn more at [Drive app value](drive-app-value.md).

## Find the right balance

It's easy to say that technology can be used to solve any business process scenario, but technology is simply what turns the gears for your processes, people, and data. It's important to include all stakeholders in the design decisions, because processes don't always align with the technology. We call that information the *gap* in a requirement. It's where you might decide to purchase an Add-on solution or develop an extension to meet the needs of the process. Think through the different options to find the right balance for your solution, but be sure to challenge the business requirements before customizing the system. You might be surprised to find out that what seemed like a *must-have* customization is more of a *nice-to-have* feature.

After the fit-gap analysis is completed, the gap solution design workshop helps to discuss and further assess the identified potential solutions to meet the requirements. This workshop provides structure to help analyze the gap solutions in terms of risk, ease of use, long term support considerations, product roadmap alignment, and so on. The purpose is to choose the solution that best fits the process and requirements.
