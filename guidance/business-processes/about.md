# About the business process guide

Microsoft has established a business process catalog of standard business processes across Dynamics 365 apps and services. Read on to learn how to navigate and learn from the catalog.  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-def](../includes/daf-business-process-def.md)]

## What is the catalog?

The business process catalog is an Excel workbook that we at Microsoft use to organize and prioritize our work on the business process documentation. The format is Excel because it makes it easy to sort and filter the entries. We also believe our partners can use the Excel workbook to organize their onboarding journeys, their implementation projects, and their own business processes. Learn more about the content in the [What's in the catalog?](#whats-in-the-catalog) section.  

Find the latest version of the catalog in [the Dynamics 365 Patterns & Practices GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365patternspractices/tree/main/templates/business-processes). You don't need a GitHub account to download the catalog. Learn more at [Business process contributions](/dynamics365/get-started/contribute.md#business-process-contributions).  

## What's in the catalog?

[!INCLUDE [daf-bus-proces-catalog](../includes/daf-bus-proces-catalog.md)]

We plan to cover each level of the catalog. The result will be guidance about how to configure Dynamics 365 to meet most use cases and scenarios. Our goal is to help our customers and partners define the scope of their implementation projects. Start from our standard business processes and accelerate your success and implementation. We hope you can then focus on the processes that make your business unique. Work with your implementation partner to identify which business processes and patterns are relevant at the beginning of your project. Also, review the [Processes](../implementation-guide/solution-architecture-design-pillars-processes.md) solution architecture design pillar.  

New and updated content will publish to the Microsoft Learn site throughout 2023 and potentially beyond.  

## How to read the business process descriptions

The business process articles contain abbreviations that you won't see anywhere else. The abbreviations represent the different Dynamics 365 apps, services, and related portals. We hope they make it easier to quickly scan the various tables. For an introduction to this type of shorthand, see [Business processes, steps, and how to find things](about-steps-navigation.md).  

For an overview of business terms, see [Glossary: Dynamics 365 business processes](glossary.md).
