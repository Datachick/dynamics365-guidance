### Streamlined categorization

Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management provides tools for categorizing products and services based on shared characteristics such as attributes, categories, and subcategories. This makes it easier to manage and organize products and to create targeted marketing strategies. When you also use other Dynamics 365 applications the product details can be synchronized using Dual Write maps to other tables and entities to support the business needs in many other applications automatically.

### Improved customer insights

When you use Dynamics 365 to categorize your products or services, your organization can gain insights into the needs and preferences of your customers. You can use this information to tailor your offerings to meet the specific needs of different customer groups. For example, in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, you can create a dynamic segment to automatically update when customers purchase a certain type of item, and then promote a similar item using a customer journey. With this approach, you can create more targeted marketing strategies that ultimately make your marketing campaigns more effective and improve the return on investment of your campaign.

### Optimize product development

When it understands the needs and preferences of different customer groups, an organization can develop products and services that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace. This can help to minimize the risk of product failures and reduce development costs. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Commerce includes flexible product categorization and attributes to support unique industry and localization requirements. When you combine this data with Power BI, you can easily analyze the data to determine which customers and products are performing better. Similar functionality is available with Dynamics 365 Sales to create product families and analyze the sales data by using Power BI.

## Increase customer loyalty

When an organization can tailor its offerings to meet the needs of different customer groups, it can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. One result can be higher retention rates and increased customer lifetime value. Dynamics 365 Commerce includes a loyalty program that enables you to track sales across every channel, and Dynamics 365 Customer Insights enables you to pull sales data from many different sources for analysis.  

## Optimize customer experiences

When you use *subjects* in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to manage cases, you can model them after categories of products and services to help categorize and analyze cases by the subjects of cases that are created and worked on. When you use automated routing with cases, this can also improve the customer experience to ensure that the right person is assigned to the ticket to help resolve the issue. This can be especially true in organization or industries where the product  mix is diverse. In cases where the product mix isn't diverse, the subject can still be helpful in analyzing trends within a given product line, for example to determine if more training or quality issues exist.
