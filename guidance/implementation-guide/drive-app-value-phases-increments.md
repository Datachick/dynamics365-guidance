# Phases and increments

Planning and scoping distinct phases of your digital transformation program directly impacts the time to value realization. What is delivered and when it's delivered also influence the level of engagement from stakeholders and business users. These phases and increments are based on the goals agreed upon with the business and allow you to select the appropriate capabilities in the transformation map.

It seems reasonable to start with the essentials and basics in Phase 1 of a solution and then deliver enhancements with the most innovative, differentiating features in later phases of the program. But if the most valuable parts of the transformation are planned for much later in the lifecycle, you risk stakeholders losing interest, or poor user perception of the system (which is hard to correct). Additionally, the features that were considered differentiators could now be essential due to time decay. A transformation program that fails to deliver beyond the essentials or the initial MVP drives little transformation.

You should plan the phases so you can pick up elements from various quadrants and deliver a holistic solution. The solution should have the key process elements, integrations, and reporting that delivers value. Look for quick wins: the latest Dynamics 365 features that you can easily adopt with little effort to bring innovative and differentiator elements into the earlier phases.

Digital transformation is as much about people as the process and technology. The phases and incremental design should also help product owners maintain the right level of engagement from users and stakeholders. This drives excitement and curiosity, but most importantly feedback. Think of a TV series that shows teasers at the end of each episode or the end of each series to attract viewers back to the program. Do the same for your digital transformation story by delivering value beyond the essentials in each phase so customers come back for more.

In the next section, we look at how the right approach to MVP strategy when getting started with your digital transformation journey can help get early feedback and drive value sooner rather than later.
