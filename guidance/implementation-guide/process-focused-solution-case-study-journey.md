# Case study - The journey to a process-focused solution

A large, multinational organization that provides contract-based servicing with some manufacturing and distribution services was planning to replace parts of its 15-year-old tier-one ERP and CRM systems and other related legacy systems.

## The wrong road

The project started with the implementation process that they had traditionally applied to other IT projects. The traditional approach was strictly Waterfall with a heavy documentation bias. The initial phase of requirements gathering was conducted by using the old systems as the reference point. A long list of requirements was gathered, with the assistance of an implementation partner, across the various functions. The requirements gathering phase was extended a few times as the requirements review took longer than expected.

The reviews needed multiple parties to read, understand, and validate the requirements. There was also a concern among the business approvers that if they missed any requirement, or even a nuance, their system wouldn't function well.

So, there were multiple document-based reviews with formal comments from the approvers. The project team wrote responses, which then generated even more comments from the approvers. This spiral of the reviews finally concluded. However, but the business wasn't entirely convinced that they fully understood what they had approved. They hoped that the design phase would provide more clarity.

The design phase was similarly based on writing and reviewing complex design documents. the phase was also running late. The focus tended to be on the "gaps" identified. But with the questions captured out of context, discussion with business users wasn't always productive. Further delays accrued, and business users were becoming even less confident about the proposed solution. So the stakeholders decided to review the project direction and the reasons for the continuous delays and general dissatisfaction.

## The change of direction

As part of the review, which included third parties, several recommendations were made. The primary recommendation was to adopt a more process-focused approach and apply the processes as the framework for a more Agile way of working. The first step in the process was to define the end-to-end process at the highest level in order to establish the boundaries of the project scope in business process terms. The subsequent steps then generated two further levels of visualization of the process detail for the business process streams. The project took deliberate steps to try to define the processes in terms of the business flow and desired business outcomes, rather than replicating the existing systems. This process mapping exercise was done at an accelerated pace, working as combined business, project, and implementation partner workstreams.

## The right road

Once there was a reasonable map of the processes, the requirements were mapped to the processes so that they could be understood in the context of a process. As a result, many of the requirements were restated and better anchored in the context of a business transaction. With this change, the requirements were less likely to be misinterpreted or removed for being redundant.

The processes at level 2 were put into a storyboard. Key contributors were the partner solution architect and the customer's lead functional expert. The customer's lead functional expert used the process flows to create logical end-to-end process flows across workstreams to make the delivery of software meaningful. The partner solution architect provided the Dynamics 365 application view of the embedded standard processes, dependencies, and constraints. Their aim was to ensure that the sequence of process delivery would be efficient within the Dynamics 365 applications. This storyboard would drive the sequence of work from realizing foundational processes to more peripheral ones. Furthermore, the level 2 end-to-end processes (such as *Prospect to Cash*) were prioritized by considering the core/most frequent/baseline path through the process as a higher priority. So the core processes would be designed and delivered before the more specialized and less frequent variations.

This set of processes in the storyboard were then mapped to an overall design within Dynamics 365 applications, generating a process-focused solution blueprint. It was reviewed against the existing technical, system, and data solution blueprint to create a rounded solution blueprint.

The delivery of the processes was distributed into sprints of four weeks each. Each sprint delivered a meaningful part of the storyboard for each of the workstreams, with an emphasis on delivery of end-to-end processes as rapidly as possible. A high-level plan was constructed based on the sequence, dependencies, and estimated effort related to process delivery.

The sprint level planning was performed on the processes in scope for that sprint, defining a more detailed process flow when required. Documentation was kept to a minimum and the processes were designed in the Dynamics 365 system in collaborative workshop environments. All related activities such as data migration, integrations, testing, training, change management, etc. were performed based on the processes in scope. Each sprint culminated in a *conference room pilot*. Some know this delivery as the *working demo* or *playback*. Across terminology, the business SMEs presents the new logical business process, and how the processes are designed and implemented in the system via a demo to an invited business audience.

At the end of each sprint, the business attendees reviewed and approved the incrementally complete and functioning processes in Dynamics 365, rather than reviewing and approving complex and technical design documents. Before, individual gap designs were circulating on paper for weeks and months. Now, they were translated into end-to-end working software. Business engagement increased as the project was talking their language, and they were working directly with the emerging Dynamics 365 system rather than with abstract design documents and lists of requirements.

## Arriving at the destination

The project further reinforced the process-centric project approach, beyond design and build. They used the processes to script and drive end-to-end testing, reporting status and progress as "ability to execute a process within the system." The senior business stakeholders on the steering group also connected with the project more meaningfully, because they were finally able to understand the project readiness and business operations implications.

The project successfully went live, and the customer continued to adopt a process-centric view throughout the remainder of their go-lives in other countries/regions. The implementation partner decided to adopt this process-centric approach as their new standard implementation approach for their other projects because they could clearly see the benefits.
