# ALM workshop strategy

The implementation team should plan for an ALM workshop before project initiation or before project kickoff. The customer and partner should gather the required processes, tools, and teams before project kickoff, such as:

- Project plan template

- Business requirement document template

- Functional and technical spec templates

- Test plan and test suite template

- Defined tools such as DevOps template

- Defined roles required for partner and customer teams

In addition to this workshop, the implementation team should plan for a Dev ALM workshop before starting development activities. Our FastTrack ALM workshop focuses on your development lifecycle and provides guidance and best practices such as development environments, version control, build automation, and release pipelines. It underlines the importance of having fast builds, quick testing, and fast deployments using automation, which helps ensure a rapid development lifecycle, especially for agile development methodology.

## Workshop scope

FastTrack ALM workshops are intended for implementers who want to make sure that their development approach meets the requirements of the implementation and aligns with typical best practices. The workshop could cover several topics, including the following subjects:

- ALM governance

  Focuses on overall ALM strategy, ADO ownership, handover plan, day-to-day activities. It reviews that the team has implementation guidelines, implementation best practices, and work items such as project management, requirement, tasks, and bugs management.

- Build management

  Reviews your version control, branching, code merging, and code reviews, build automation and build pipeline strategy. Branching can be simple or complex depending on the project and phases. It also looks at how customization is checked in, such as gated check-in and whether managed/unmanaged solutions are being deployed to non-development CE apps.

- Release management

  Looks at your build tools, automated deployments, Code/Solution deployment, Update strategy, Environment specific to ALM, Config movement, etc. It reviews your build plan for Build definitions, different variables, and build triggers for your implementation. It also reviews how hotfixes and your code release, or service updates, are applied to production and nonproduction environments.

- Multi-platform app strategy

  Reviews your strategy if there are multiple dynamics apps involved such as Supply Chain Management app, Sales app, Power Apps, etc.

## Timing

It's important to ensure ALM workshops are conducted at the right time. Ideally, the ALM workshop should be before project kickoff, and the Dev ALM workshop should be before starting development or sooner.

You should complete both workshops either in the *Initiate* phase or when starting the *Implement* phase. If you plan ALM workshops too far into implementation, any findings and recommendations could cause significant rework.
