# Plan and budget assets overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to support your organization's business processes to plan and budget assets.

## Introduction to plan and budget assets

Companies generally use capital assets – tangible or intangible - to run business operations. Planning and budgeting assets is a crucial factor in determining the financial stability of a company. When an organization forecasts the costs associated with acquiring, maintaining, and replacing assets and estimates the expenses and cash flow requirements, they help make sure they have sufficient funds for the maintenance budget.

Often, businesses use historical data to plan and budget new asset purchases. If the business is new, planning asset requirements may require deeper understanding aspects such as the loffowing list:

- The business model  
- The long term and short-term growth model  
- Requirements from different business units  
- The overall market strategy  

A structured approach to planning and budgeting for assets is also an indicator of a mature organization that aims at reducing the uncertainties and risks through effective asset management and maintenance. This, in turn, can instill confidence in the stakeholders to invest in the vision and goals of the company.

## Plan and budget assets stakeholders

Many people in an organization must contribute to the decision-making process and design of the plan and budget assets process in your Dynamics 365 project. Stakeholders include the roles listed in the following list:

- Asset managers - responsible for managing the lifecycle of assets

- IT department - responsible for maintaining and testing technology solutions

- Finance department - responsible for tracking asset costs

- Operations department - responsible for maintaining the maintenance schedule of the assets to support business operations and providing inputs if an asset requires any reactive maintenance

- Human resources department – responsible for hiring and training users who maintain and repair the assets

- Procurement department - responsible for purchasing spare parts and managing vendor relationships

- Legal and compliance department - responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance related to asset management

- Executive leadership - responsible for overseeing the acquisition and disposal of high-value assets and ensuring alignment with strategic goals.

## Plan and budget assets benefits

The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might measure to plan and budget assets.  

### Refined asset planning process

A well-planned process for purchasing, deploying, maintaining, and disposing of assets year-on-year helps organizations build a strong asset planning and budgeting strategy. The subsequent budgets can have better data to plan for future requirements of assets and their maintenance.

### Optimized resource allocation

Planning and budgeting require evaluating both the needs of the business as well as the condition and performance of the existing assets. As a result, it gives organizations a holistic picture of the cost-effective strategy for either replacing assets or reallocating them where the assets can be more efficient.

### Risk management

With effective asset planning and budgeting, organizations can assess potential risks such as redundant assets, equipment failures, end-of-life software and any noncompliant practices. This information can help with drawing up a proactive maintenance and replacement plan that can reduce the operational risks and in turn, optimize asset lifecycle.

### Improved asset lease management

With Dynamics 365, organizations can manage the leased assets as a lessee more effectively. Capabilities such as the following are built in:

- Lease accounting  
- Lease management  
- Lease portfolio analysis  

These and other capabilities can help organizations to reduce the risk of lease errors, improve lease compliance, and achieve cost savings. Learn more at [Asset leasing home page](/dynamics365/finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-homepage).
