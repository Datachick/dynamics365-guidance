# Solution architecture design pillars

You must be sure about the solution before you start building, because failure isn't an option.  

You can't have a solution without first having a *vision*. When you know the answer you're looking for, then find a *solution* to get you there. But it's not always easy to know and articulate what you want, let alone identify the elements that are essential for creating a blueprint of your solution.

In this article and related articles, we outline the pillars of a successful solution architecture design that will support your vision. You'll get building blocks you can use to create a coherent and satisfying outcome. Use the Success by Design framework as a structured approach for designing a solution with Dynamics 365 apps.  

## What are solution architecture design pillars?

Most of us know what *architecture* means in the building industry. It includes the job of the architect, the scope of the work, and what's ultimately delivered. The architect starts with the project requirements and the budget, and then works on a blueprint of the design. Once the physical labor begins, the foundation is laid, the house is built, and the interior is completed. Many years of maintaining and improving the building may follow. But why and when do you need an architect to design a solution for your organization?

Let's look at how to build a new house for a dog. In most cases, it's a single-person job with a general vision of the final product. Building a doghouse is cheap, and the risk of failure is low, so a trial-and-error approach is one option.

But what if you were asked to build something as complex as the Sydney Opera House in Australia? The approach would be different: it takes more than one person to complete the job, the design must be carefully planned, and architects, construction workers, plumbers, electricians, and decorators have to coordinate their workflow. With so many moving parts, there must be well-defined processes, an explicit design, and powerful tools. When all the right pillars are in place, the likelihood of failure is dramatically reduced.

Solution architecture follows a systematic approach by identifying the desired solution and the necessary building blocks, where each builds on the previous block and provides a foundation for the next block. Solution architecture breaks up the work into logical sections, and coordinates those sections, managing and mitigating the risks along the way.

## Building blocks of solution architecture design

The journey starts with a *vision*. The vision details are articulated in a *business strategy*. To build the solution, *processes*, *people*, and *data* must be joined in a *solution architecture*. A solution strategy outlines how those elements can be addressed by using the technology of Dynamics 365 apps. Project and change methodologies, supported by governance and control methods, define the workflows and the delivery.

Solution architecture design incorporates the business vision and its implementation into a blueprint. The first version is created as part of the pre-sales process and forms the initial high-level understanding of what you plan to build.

Solution architecture enables implementation of a vision, and typically begins after the business strategy has been crafted, but before the solution is built and implemented. Architecture creates a picture of the finished product and includes the specifications needed to build it.

A solution architect provides the necessary quality control by ensuring that key requirements are met, with all relevant interdependencies considered and managed. A solution architect also serves as a translator between the business and IT teams to articulate the impact of technology on the business, and vice versa.

## Next steps

As weâ€™ve explained in this article, solution architecture follows a systematic approach that identifies your desired solution and the building blocks needed to construct it. Solution architecture design takes your business vision and breaks it into logical sections that become a blueprint for building your solution. Here's a list of the key steps for solution architecture design:

- Define your vision. Learn more at [Solution architecture design: Vision and strategies](solution-architecture-design-pillars-vision-strategies.md)
