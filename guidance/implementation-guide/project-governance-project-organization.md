# Project organization in Dynamics 365 implementation projects

Projects implementing business applications tend to have common structures and roles (such as project manager, solution architect, subject matter expert, functional consultant, and technical consultant) that are recognizable across different projects. The difference in the effectiveness of project teams comes from the way in which the project organization functions in practice compared to the theoretical constructs.

|Project Organization  |
|---------|
|- Project team aligned to business|
|- Active and appropriate senior stakeholders|
|- Structure promotes cross-team collaboration|
|- Clear project leadership accountability and authority|
|- Clear team roles and responsibilities|
|- Roles aligned to solution and design requirements|
|- Resources are proportional to effort and complexity|

When assessing your project organization, consider the questions that are asked in the following sections.

## How well is the project team aligned to the business?

Teams that have good alignment between the business streams and project functional workstreams tend to have more effective and higher-velocity projects. A common model is for each key business stream to be matched with a corresponding project workstream. An experienced leader from the business stream is usually seconded to the project and takes on the role of the lead subject matter expert (SME). For larger projects, multiple SMEs may be appointed to a single workstream.

The direct involvement of a business stream with the project is usually the most successful model because it engenders trust both ways, from the business to the project and vice versa. If you have multiple organizational steps between the business and the project team SMEs, the level of business ownership of the solution design diminishes, and the quality of the input from the SMEs.

## Does the project organization include active and appropriate senior business stakeholders?

Projects are far more successful when senior business stakeholders have clear roles and are active and deeply engaged in driving the project. A good sign for the project is when the senior stakeholders are:

- Keenly interested in the status of critical processes

- Making a direct impact on the prioritization of tasks

- Making the corresponding resources available.

Projects in which the senior stakeholders are more passive and just occasionally asking "How is it going?" or "Let me know if you need something" tend to have poor outcomes.

## Does the structure promote cross-team collaboration?

Examine if the following aspects naturally generate sufficient cross-team collaboration, or if they naturally encourage silos:  

- Project organization  
- Project structure  
- Reporting lines  
- Team leadership and composition  
- Communication channels  
- team objectives  
- Delivery approach  

Danger signs are project organization structures with the following issues:

- Team members performing the delivery work on the ground have to navigate multiple layers of management to overcome issues

- Members of workstreams rarely work with other workstreams

- Responses to improvised questions on a team member's task status and issues are routed via the project manager. It also introduces mistrust within the team

- Workstream communication channels are all hierarchical, with few organic, cross-workstream objectives

A good way to determine the level of cross-stream collaboration is, for example, to scrutinize how closely, and how often, the data migration workstream works with the various functional and technical workstreams' design. How closely entwined are the ongoing delivery objectives of the data migration team and those of the functional team? Do they primarily communicate hierarchically or across to their teammates in other areas? Consider looking at similar interactions across the other workstreams to determine whether the project structure and organization promotes or hinders collaboration.

## Is accountability and authority well defined at the project leadership level?

Projects where the wrong role is accountable for delivery or where the accountability is diffuse tend to have low velocity, with project decisions stagnating. Projects where the accountability is given to someone too junior in the organization to have the corresponding authority may also languish without sufficient direction and resources.

## How well are the team roles and responsibilities defined?

Every role on the project needs to be well defined, including roles that may be part-time on the project. The critical role played by business users that aren't seconded to the project is often ill-defined. They may typically be necessary for defining a detailed process or data requirements, for approving business processes, or for preparing and performing testing. They're critical activities, and the corresponding roles should be well defined so the resources can be planned and their tasks and status are visible to the project leadership.

## How well are the team roles aligned to the solution complexity and system design requirements?

You should conduct an honest analysis of the experience and ability of the resources in key roles when compared to the complexity of the design and its constraints. Be wary of job titles that don't match the experience and authority that normally accompany such titles.

It's important for the key roles of lead solution architect, lead technical architect, and project manager.

## Are the levels of resources proportional to the level of effort and complexity?

By the end of the Initiate phase of the project, you should have a reasonably credible high-level solution blueprint, a reasonable estimate of the backlog and effort, and a high-level project plan. This should provide a good grounding for reviewing the level of resources planned for the key roles.

This honest review is especially recommended for the roles that are likely to be the most constrained, so that any mitigation plans can be initiated in a timely manner.

During the implementation, regularly assess how the day-to-day working of the control, communication, and feedback functions are helped or hindered by the project team organization. How well does the project organization structure facilitate or constrict the undiluted and timely flow of direction, guidance, and decisions from the business to the project workstreams? In the other direction, does the structure enable or hinder the flow of accurate, actionable, and timely feedback from the workstreams to the project leadership and business stakeholders?

A typical setback on projects is the leadership team not receiving timely and accurate feedback on project issues, therefore adding unnecessary cost and delays. This is often due to structural issues created by a project organization that doesn't help the flow of meaningful information. Projects with much hierarchical communication and reporting-line hoops to clear (especially on large projects) tend to have difficulties in surfacing accurate data promptly. This can result in project challenges stagnating for too long, which leads to delays and extra cost.

Many projects start with the ambition of some model of partnership and shared leadership with the various parties involved. The projects that better achieve this ambition are the ones that meaningfully map the commercial and partnership arrangements (or expectations if informally agreed) and their respective expertise to the project organization. Projects tend to have better success when the customer has a clear leadership (and ownership) role in the organization structure driving the overall project. Similarly, unless the customer has experience and capability in implementing business applications, having the implementation partner in a leadership (and accountability) role allows for the best mapping of leadership roles to those with the best experience. In this case, the partner provides strategic guidance on the implementation methodologies, system design, and technical procedures. Depending on the specific expertise between the customer and partners, the actual balance of responsibility lies somewhere in the spectrum of these arrangements, and the organization structure should be mapped to that agreement.

In business application projects, some critical project roles have a disproportionate impact on the success of a business application project. For most projects, the role of the solution architects and the project manager is critical to success. The project manager and solution architect roles are important both from the implementation partner and from the customer; the customer solution architect is described as the lead business SME or the business lead. Depending on which areas of your project are significant or risky, you may want to add other roles to the list of the critical project roles. You should then pay extra attention to ensure that the individuals chosen for these critical roles have the right level of experience and capability. For example, an ineffective solution architect may not be able to direct the solution design blueprint such that the different elements of the solution design come together into a coherent and efficient solution that matches the business needs.

You should also confirm that the project organization allows all roles to be successful by letting them properly assert their expertise and strongly influence the design and implementation. As a result, they deliver the full positive impact of their roles.
