# Define a strategy for adoption and change management

Adoption and change management planning is a critical aspect of implementation strategy. Change is never easy for any organization and requires thoughtful planning and a structured approach to achieve high adoption and usage. A change management strategy with a clear action plan ensures smooth rollouts and alignment with stakeholder and end user expectations. In the absence of a planned change management approach, many business applications tend to become purely data entry tools rather than value enhancing user centric applications.

## Bridge the gap between business requirements and results

All too often, projects meet requirements without a true focus on adoption and business outcomes. Users experience a change in their day-to-day work as a direct result of a gap between technology solutions and business outcomes. Change management focuses on bridging this gap by effectively supporting and equipping the user community to successfully adopt the transition. You need a healthy mindset across different functions, including the project development teams, to keep the final user experience a primary design consideration.

### Increase likelihood of project success

Since June 2014, Microsoft has licensed the [Prosci Change Management methodology and tools](https://www.prosci.com/blog/spotlight-leader-of-change-management-at-microsoft) for internal and external use.  Prosci's correlation data shows that initiatives with planned change management are six times more likely to meet objectives than projects without a formal change management strategy. The data is abundantly clear. The better we apply change management, the more likely we are to deliver on project objectives.

Make your change management strategy successful by covering the following aspects:

- Continuous executive sponsorship  
- Integration with the project management teams  
- Employee engagement  
- Frequent and open communication
